It not only gives us fortitude to bear pain, but teaches us at every step the precarious tenure on which we hold our present being. Sedentary and studious men are the most apprehensive on this score.Dr. John was an instance in point. A few years seemed to him soon over, compared with those sweeping contemplations on time and infinity with which he had been used to pose himself. In the still life of a man of letters there was no obvious reason for a change. He might sit in an arm chair and pour out cups of tea to all eternity would it had been possible for him to do so. The most rational cure after all for the inordinate fear of death is to get a just value on life. If we mere wish to continue on the scene to indulge our head-strong humour and tormenting passions, we had better be gone at once; and if we only cherish a fondness for existence according to the good we desire from it, the pang we feel at parting which it will not be very server. 1. Suggest a suitable title for the passage. 2. What type of people are afraid of death and why? 3. How can we get rid of the fear of death? 4. What idea do you form about Dr Johnson from this passage? 5. Explain the meanings of the words written in bold types. 6. Make a précis of the passage. pasagot please ​</a>

                                            Read the following passage and answer the questions given at the end. 
You have probably written a summary after the completion of a book you have
read. You may have told about the characters. You may have told about the setting.
You probably told about how a problem was solved. But did you know that
summarizing is not just for stories? You can use your summarizing skills to be better
prepared in all your subjects.
Some students have a hard time with science and social studies because there
are lots of new words There is also a lot of information to remember. Research shows
that just writing things down will help you remember them. It works even if you never
read what you wrote again. Wow! That’s a great reason for taking notes.
Did you know that taking notes is summarizing? When you read your science and
social studies textbooks, keep a notebook with lined paper close to you. Most
textbooks are divided into sections that have headings. Headings are like titles in
darker letters. Write down the headings of each section before you read the selection.
As you read, jot down the big ideas. Look for the new words. You can also use your
summary to study!
Answer the following questions based on the reading passage.
1.Why are science and social studies hard for some people?
2. What does research say about writing things down?
3.What is heading in your textbook?
4. Based on the other information in the last paragraph, what do the words jot down
mean?
5. What can you use when you study? 6. Write a summary of the given text. please answer it</a>

It not only gives us fortitude to bear pain, but teaches us at every step the precarious tenure on which we hold our present being. Sedentary and studious men are the most apprehensive on this score.Dr. John was an instance in point. A few years seemed to him soon over, compared with those sweeping contemplations on time and infinity with which he had been used to pose himself. In the still life of a man of letters there was no obvious reason for a change. He might sit in an arm chair and pour out cups of tea to all eternity would it had been possible for him to do so. The most rational cure after all for the inordinate fear of death is to get a just value on life. If we mere wish to continue on the scene to indulge our head-strong humour and tormenting passions, we had better be gone at once; and if we only cherish a fondness for existence according to the good we desire from it, the pang we feel at parting which it will not be very server. 1.

                            25. Read the following passage and answer the questions given at the end. 
You have probably written a summary after the completion of a book you have
read. You may have told about the characters. You may have told about the setting.
You probably told about how a problem was solved. But did you know that
summarizing is not just for stories? You can use your summarizing skills to be better
prepared in all your subjects.
Some students have a hard time with science and social studies because there
are lots of new words There is also a lot of information to remember. Research shows
that just writing things down will help you remember them. It works even if you never
read what you wrote again. Wow! That’s a great reason for taking notes.
Did you know that taking notes is summarizing? When you read your science and
social studies textbooks, keep a notebook with lined paper close to you. Most
textbooks are divided into sections that have headings. Headings are like titles in
darker letters. Write down the headings of each section before you read the selection.
As you read, jot down the big ideas. Look for the new words. You can also use your
summary to study!
Answer the following questions based on the reading passage.
1.Why are science and social studies hard for some people?
2. What does research say about writing things down?
3.What is heading in your textbook?
4. Based on the other information in the last paragraph, what do the words jot down
mean?
