One of the main reasons school rules exist is to create safety for students. Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyone arrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape. For this reason, there may be some basic safety rules, such as no running in the halls, no crossing the street without help from the guard, no horseplay on the playground and no bringing items that could be used as weapons to school. Leaming to follow school rules early on helps kids understand why rules are important well into adulthood. So, we should follow school rules! ____3. The beach is the perfect place for me.

                                            What's the summary of Hyde Park by Petina Gappah?
	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.
London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.
As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.
I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.
I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.
I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.
Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity
It is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.
I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.

Activities included white-water rafting, horseback riding and all-day hiking trips on mountain peaks. I like being close to nature. I could hardly wait until March when my father arrives. 16. Mrs. Bertha Stevens was an aristocrat of Black Stamps. She had the grace of control to appear warm in the coldest weather and on the summer days, it seemed she had a private breeze which swirled around cooling her. She was thin yet lovely with her long curly hair and her printed violet dress and flowered hat. 17. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Fleming in 1928. Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various micro-organism and other living systems and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses, 18. Water is essential to human life. Man uses water for drinking and for cleansing himself, his food and the things he uses. Farmers use water for their farms. Every farmers knows that one of the effect of either inadequate or excessive water is poor harvest. Poor yield means less profit. If a farmer can have just enough water for his farm, neither too much nor too little, he can be sure to have the highest possible yield. 19. Logging is one of the country's top dollar earners. Millions of board feet of hard wood are exported yearly to Japan, the United States, Europe and the Middle East. As a result millions of dollars pour into the national treasury. Many forests are denuded. Life, property and crops are lost due to flush floods. 20. It is a garden, a lovely one. At the center is a fountain whose water flows a continuously day and night. Around the fountain is a cement boarder where plants are placed regular intervals. The plants are full of flowers. Bushes stand on all sides of the garden.

They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old they believed that they must always live alone.In the garden near their house this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables.Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it.They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, “Please be careful that you do not hurt me.”The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy. He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed.Presently the woman went to the spring for a jar of water, and when she had brought it she spread a mat on the floor and began to bathe the baby. As the drops of water fell off his body, they were immediately changed to gold, so that when the bath was finished gold pieces covered the mat. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever.The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.pa answer kailangan kanapo kasi?​</a>

                                            In a queer fittle bamboo house in front of a big garden hved a man and his wife all alone. They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old, they believed that they must always live alone. In the garden near their house, this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables. Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it. They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, "Please be careful that you do not hurt me." The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy [1] He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed. 1. squash is the only food that the couple eats every day. from this statement tell the setting of the story and the source of income of the people? 2. what negative trait does the couple possessed? 3. if we are to analyze the couples characters they were not as greedy as day were when they are still poor what do you think have changed their behavior? 4. what do you think will happen if the couple became contented with that they had? 5. what lesson did the story taught us? pls give me correct answer​</a>

Give an example of a figurative language used in the literary piece and identify its kind. 3. Give 2 other topics that can be featured in creative-nonfiction"Hyde Park" By: Petina Gappah	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</a>

                            16. What's the summary of Hyde Park by Petina Gappah?
	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.
London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.
As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.
I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.
I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.
I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.
Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity
It is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.
I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Step-by-step explanation:</p><p>Emotional intelligence at work places</p><p>Emotional intelligence at work places is measured against the following parameters; energy, stress, optimism, self esteem, change, detail and courage (Wall 2007, p. 50). Energy as a measure of emotional intelligence focuses on the physical involvement that an individual directs to the execution process of the job. The energy that an individual directs to carrying out a project tends to vary with the mood as well as the interest that they have in the job.</p><p></p><p>Self esteem defines the value that we regard ourselves with, people with high esteem attach high value to themselves where as those with low esteem tend to underrate themselves. Self esteem also looks at the belief we have over what we are capable of doing. Those who regard themselves excessively high or have very high self esteem tend to disregard others or view others as lesser beings than them (Stough &amp; Saklofske 2009). Such an attitude may be a hindrance to effective social interaction with others.</p><p></p><p>Workers like it when factors that compromise their self esteem are eliminated in the work environment so that the work they do is well appreciated by the seniors. Business managers who do not regard their employees with high value are more likely to get poor performance from the employees’ compared to those who appreciate and regard their employees. Stress refers to the way human beings tend to react to situations that undermine their capability. Stress also encompasses the reactions that we have over what we are not willing to accept in our lives</p><p></p><p>Details refer to ones ability to check and point out the fine details of the job requirement. Some managers are more keen on details where as others apply the hands type of leadership in business. The later manager may be more involved in affairs that would better be left to employees to handle.</p><p></p><p>This is an indication of lack of emotional intelligence for managers to be too involved in fine details that the workers are supposed to take care of on their own. It is important to be keen to work details and ensure all is going on well as a manager in an organization; however this should be carried out at a moderated level so that the workers are allowed some little freedom to direct themselves.</p><p></p><p>Managers who on the other hand keep their eyes to the work at a distance and allow the workers to rule and make decisions on their own are more likely to promote carelessness at the work place. Human beings react and adapt to the work environment according to the standards that are set out for them.</p><p></p><p>A hand off leadership is a show of lack of proper human skills to engage the workers more closely. Change as a parameter of measuring emotional intelligence reflects on ones ability to adapt to new ideas and process in the work place. There are individuals who are used to routine work and quite resistant to changes in the work place. These are classified as the low achievers who can not work hard to adapt to new changes in the routine (Wall 2007, p. 52). Work environments that offer variability and change calls forWhat is WordCounter?</p><p>Apart from counting words and characters, our online editor can help you to improve word choice and writing style, and, optionally, help you to detect grammar mistakes and plagiarism.

They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old they believed that they must always live alone.In the garden near their house this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables.Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it.They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, “Please be careful that you do not hurt me.”The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy. He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed.Presently the woman went to the spring for a jar of water, and when she had brought it she spread a mat on the floor and began to bathe the baby. As the drops of water fell off his body, they were immediately changed to gold, so that when the bath was finished gold pieces covered the mat. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever.The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.pa answer kailangan kanapo kasi?​</h2><br />

                            28. In a queer fittle bamboo house in front of a big garden hved a man and his wife all alone. They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old, they believed that they must always live alone. In the garden near their house, this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables. Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it. They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, "Please be careful that you do not hurt me." The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy [1] He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed. 1. squash is the only food that the couple eats every day. from this statement tell the setting of the story and the source of income of the people? 2. what negative trait does the couple possessed? 3. if we are to analyze the couples characters they were not as greedy as day were when they are still poor what do you think have changed their behavior? 4. what do you think will happen if the couple became contented with that they had? 5. what lesson did the story taught us? pls give me correct answer​</h2><br />

Give 2 other topics that can be featured in creative-nonfiction"Hyde Park" By: Petina Gappah	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</h2><br />
