                                            Learning Task 3: Read the story, then enumerate the events by filling in the graphic organizers below: Makato and the Cowrie Shell (A Thai Folktale) by Supanee Khanchanathiti Once upon a time, there was a boy whose name was Makato. He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work— carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, goodtempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far–off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. ―What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. ―I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. ―I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. ―The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. ―They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind–hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month‘s journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. ―Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. ―I‘m so thirsty. ―Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you‘ve come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. ―Thank you so much, said the boy. ―Who are your father and mother? Haven‘t you any family? the old woman asked again. ―I come from the City of Mon over there, replied Makato. ―Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? ―I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. ―You are a very determined boy! said the woman.‖Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants‘ sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants‘ sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. ―Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. ―How old is he? the king asked further. ―12 years old, your Majesty, replied the mahout. ―A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. ―Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie (the photo is the last part of the story)​</a>

He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work—carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, goodtempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far–off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. ―What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. ―I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. ―I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. ―The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. ―They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind–hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month‘s journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. ―Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. ―I‘m so thirsty. ―Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you‘ve come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. ―Thank you so much, said the boy. ―Who are your father and mother? Haven‘t you any family? the old woman asked again. ―I come from the City of Mon over there, replied Makato. ―Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? ―I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. ―You are a very determined boy! said the woman.‖Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants‘ sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants‘ sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once withhis hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. ―Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. ―How old is he? the king asked further.―12 years old, your Majesty, replied the mahout. ―A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. ―Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie (the photo is the last part of the story)​</a>

                            5. Learning Task 3: Read the story, then enumerate the events by filling in the graphic organizers below: Makato and the Cowrie Shell (A Thai Folktale) by Supanee Khanchanathiti Once upon a time, there was a boy whose name was Makato. He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work— carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, goodtempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far–off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. ―What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. ―I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. ―I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. ―The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. ―They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind–hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month‘s journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. ―Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. ―I‘m so thirsty. ―Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you‘ve come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. ―Thank you so much, said the boy. ―Who are your father and mother? Haven‘t you any family? the old woman asked again. ―I come from the City of Mon over there, replied Makato. ―Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? ―I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. ―You are a very determined boy! said the woman.‖Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants‘ sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants‘ sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. ―Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. ―How old is he? the king asked further. ―12 years old, your Majesty, replied the mahout. ―A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. ―Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie (the photo is the last part of the story)​</h2><br />

You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month‘s journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. ―Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. ―I‘m so thirsty. ―Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you‘ve come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. ―Thank you so much, said the boy. ―Who are your father and mother? Haven‘t you any family? the old woman asked again. ―I come from the City of Mon over there, replied Makato. ―Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? ―I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. ―You are a very determined boy! said the woman.‖Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants‘ sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants‘ sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once withhis hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. ―Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. ―How old is he? the king asked further.―12 years old, your Majesty, replied the mahout. ―A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. ―Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie (the photo is the last part of the story)​</h2><br />
