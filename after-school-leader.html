In a small community of farmers, a mining company was established. This company was openly accepted by the local government officials because of the income and employment that it could provide to the community. The company was near the community residences and also the school. As a matter of fact, the mining company was generous to the school as it regularly gives donations. After ten years of operation, the community began to experiencing health problems and poor farmer productivity. The people mobilized and asked for assistance in the investigation. The findings of the investigation showed that the root cause of the problem was the leakage coming from the mining operations. The local government protected the mining company because stopping or disturbing its operations would result in less income for the local government and unemployment for some members of the community. A community youth organization was asked to participate and lead the advocacy. What would you do if you were the leader or a member of this organization? Processing Questions: 4. What guided you in your decision?​</a>

In a small community of farmers, a mining company was established. This company was openly accepted by the local government officials because of the income and employment that it could provide to the community. The company was near the community residences and also the school. As a matter of fact, the mining company was generous to the school as it regularly gives donations. After ten years of operation, the community began to experiencing health problems and poor farmer productivity. The people mobilized and asked for assistance in the investigation. The findings of the investigation showed that the root cause of the problem was the leakage coming from the mining operations. The local government protected the mining company because stopping or disturbing its operations would result in less income for the local government and unemployment for some members of the community. A community youth organization was asked to participate and lead the advocacy. What would you do if you were the leader or a member of this organization? Processing Questions: 4. What guided you in your decision?​</a>

Reflect and respond to the followingstatements and questions: Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to school. However, she lived in an area where some political leaders didn’t want her to go to school. They used to attack the schools and try to stop girls going to school. Question: What would you do if the people with political power in your area attacked your school and said you (whether you are a boy or a girl) weren’t allowed to go anymore? So, one day this young girl, who was only eleven years old at the time, started to make speeches and write blogs saying that girls should be allowed to go to school as well. Question: How do you think the people with political power, who wereagainst girls in school, might have reacted when she started doing this?However, the people in power, who didn’t want girls to go to school, wanted to frighten her to stop her telling people these things. They knew lots of people around the world were listening to what she was saying, so they made it clear that they would harm her if she kept saying these things. Question: If someone threatened you for saying your opinion, would you stop or would you carry on anyway? The young girl did not stop saying her opinions. So, one day, when she was fourteen years old, a man came onto the bus when she was on her way back from school and shot her. The bullet hit her head. Luckily, this young girl did not die.Question: If you had been harmed for saying your opinions and survived, would you stop after that? She was taken to another country and she survived. She went on to finish school and continues to tell the world that girls should be allowed to go to school. Question: What do you think of this girl? Do you think what she did made an impact? Why/ why not? This girl is Malala Yousafzai and this happened between 2008 and 2012. In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a leading global advocate championing the equal right to education for all, especially for girls.➢ Is Malala Yousafzai is a role model for you? Why / why not? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Women can be as good at being leaders and role models as men. ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Do you think we need more role models like Malala in the world and our local community? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Could you be someone like Malala, passionate about something you believe in, in your local community?______________________________________________________________________________➢ As a student how can you become active contributors towards eradication of gender inequality, ______________________________________________​</a>

                                            School Management in a PandemicExcerpt from the article written by a Teacher 3 at Magapit National High School in Cagayan.In times of crisis, leaders are the ones we depend upon to calm our nerves and plan a clear path ahead even if taking that path requires great toil and sacrifice. Faced with almost unbearable pressure and stress, school principals are at the forefront of “pandemic learning.” The Covid-19 pandemic prompted educational leaders around the globe to make tough choices. How can they best look after the welfare of their staff and students and come out strong and learned?Leaders must act swiftly and with foresight but also with careful consideration of options, consequences and side effects of actions taken. They must communicate with clarity and purpose but also with empathy and humanity. The pandemic has exacerbated the learning crisis for low-income and middle-income countries in Asia and the Pacific, and this will likely translate into loss in lifetime opportunities and earnings. The flexibility and innovation needed to support a school’s critical academic, social-emotional and custodial functions requires school leaders to acquire and apply new knowledge, skills and capacities in their planning and decision making. An educator once said, “We must plan for the unplanned. We must be able to pivot based on evolving circumstances by altering duties, expectations, procedures, calendars, schedules, curricula and operational practices.”Improved communication, professional development and technology integration will be necessary to shift schools to be more fluid and responsive. With this flexibility, we can fix problems and initiate improvements as they arise.1.

What are the things that the school management were forced to do during the pandemic? ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________3. Do you agree or disagree with the statement: “We must plan for the unplanned”?

In a small community of farmers, a mining company was established. This company was openly accepted by the local government officials because of the income and employment that it could provide to the community. The company was near the community residences and also the school. As a matter of fact, the mining company was generous to the school as it regularly gives donations. After ten years of operation, the community began to experiencing health problems and poor farmer productivity. The people mobilized and asked for assistance in the investigation. The findings of the investigation showed that the root cause of the problem was the leakage coming from the mining operations. The local government protected the mining company because stopping or disturbing its operations would result in less income for the local government and unemployment for some members of the community. A community youth organization was asked to participate and lead the advocacy. What would you do if you were the leader or a member of this organization? Processing Questions: 4.

In a small community of farmers, a mining company was established. This company was openly accepted by the local government officials because of the income and employment that it could provide to the community. The company was near the community residences and also the school. As a matter of fact, the mining company was generous to the school as it regularly gives donations. After ten years of operation, the community began to experiencing health problems and poor farmer productivity. The people mobilized and asked for assistance in the investigation. The findings of the investigation showed that the root cause of the problem was the leakage coming from the mining operations. The local government protected the mining company because stopping or disturbing its operations would result in less income for the local government and unemployment for some members of the community. A community youth organization was asked to participate and lead the advocacy. What would you do if you were the leader or a member of this organization? Processing Questions: 4. What guided you in your decision?​</h2><br />

                            18.  Activity 2. A Powerful Story “From Where I Stand” (A Gender Equality Project For the Global Goals)Directions: Read a story below. Reflect and respond to the followingstatements and questions: Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to school. However, she lived in an area where some political leaders didn’t want her to go to school. They used to attack the schools and try to stop girls going to school. Question: What would you do if the people with political power in your area attacked your school and said you (whether you are a boy or a girl) weren’t allowed to go anymore? So, one day this young girl, who was only eleven years old at the time, started to make speeches and write blogs saying that girls should be allowed to go to school as well. Question: How do you think the people with political power, who wereagainst girls in school, might have reacted when she started doing this?However, the people in power, who didn’t want girls to go to school, wanted to frighten her to stop her telling people these things. They knew lots of people around the world were listening to what she was saying, so they made it clear that they would harm her if she kept saying these things. Question: If someone threatened you for saying your opinion, would you stop or would you carry on anyway? The young girl did not stop saying her opinions. So, one day, when she was fourteen years old, a man came onto the bus when she was on her way back from school and shot her. The bullet hit her head. Luckily, this young girl did not die.Question: If you had been harmed for saying your opinions and survived, would you stop after that? She was taken to another country and she survived. She went on to finish school and continues to tell the world that girls should be allowed to go to school. Question: What do you think of this girl? Do you think what she did made an impact? Why/ why not? This girl is Malala Yousafzai and this happened between 2008 and 2012. In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a leading global advocate championing the equal right to education for all, especially for girls.➢ Is Malala Yousafzai is a role model for you? Why / why not? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Women can be as good at being leaders and role models as men. ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Do you think we need more role models like Malala in the world and our local community? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Could you be someone like Malala, passionate about something you believe in, in your local community?______________________________________________________________________________➢ As a student how can you become active contributors towards eradication of gender inequality, ______________________________________________​</h2><br />

                            29. School Management in a PandemicExcerpt from the article written by a Teacher 3 at Magapit National High School in Cagayan.In times of crisis, leaders are the ones we depend upon to calm our nerves and plan a clear path ahead even if taking that path requires great toil and sacrifice. Faced with almost unbearable pressure and stress, school principals are at the forefront of “pandemic learning.” The Covid-19 pandemic prompted educational leaders around the globe to make tough choices. How can they best look after the welfare of their staff and students and come out strong and learned?Leaders must act swiftly and with foresight but also with careful consideration of options, consequences and side effects of actions taken. They must communicate with clarity and purpose but also with empathy and humanity. The pandemic has exacerbated the learning crisis for low-income and middle-income countries in Asia and the Pacific, and this will likely translate into loss in lifetime opportunities and earnings. The flexibility and innovation needed to support a school’s critical academic, social-emotional and custodial functions requires school leaders to acquire and apply new knowledge, skills and capacities in their planning and decision making. An educator once said, “We must plan for the unplanned. We must be able to pivot based on evolving circumstances by altering duties, expectations, procedures, calendars, schedules, curricula and operational practices.”Improved communication, professional development and technology integration will be necessary to shift schools to be more fluid and responsive. With this flexibility, we can fix problems and initiate improvements as they arise.1.

What are the things that the school management were forced to do during the pandemic? ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________3.
