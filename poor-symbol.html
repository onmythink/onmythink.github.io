                        <p>Answer:</p><p>1. I disagree with this sentence. Poor people who work hard can get the fruit of their labor and hardwork when they are responsible and devoted to their work while other poor people whom are lazy won't achieve anything and will just stay as a poor person. The rich people can spend all their money on any things they want but remember one thing, "Not eveything is everlasting and permanent." </p><p>2. I agree with this sentence because every people make their own actions and decisions. Every action and decision a person makes has a consequence. If a person did a terrible mistake, that person shouldn't lie and put the blame on others knowing that he or she did it. Instead, everyone should be responsible, honest and knows how to reflect on their actions. </p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Sorry, I can't figure out that symbols, bago kasi sakin. </p><p>Aral nang mabuti! </p><br />

pa answer pls </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>☀︎︎The canon contained four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), Acts, 21 letters, and one book of a strictly revelatory character, Revelation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>☀︎︎This is the third lesson in our series The Gospels and we have entitled it "The Gospel According to Mark." In this lesson, we'll look closely at Mark's record of Jesus' life so that we can apply his teachings more effectively to our modern lives.</p><p></p><p>☀︎︎In Christian doctrine, Jesus is identified as the Messiah and is called Christ (from the Greek for Messiah). ... The Gospel according to Matthew identifies Jesus as the Messiah and even as the son of God: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God." (Matthew 16:16).</p><p></p><p>7.)Symbol daw sayo</p><p></p><p>8)?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>9.)Matthew the Evangelist, the author of the first gospel account, is symbolized by a winged man, or angel. Matthew's gospel starts with Joseph's genealogy from Abraham; it represents Jesus' Incarnation, and so Christ's human nature. This signifies that Christians should use their reason for salvation.</p><p>Mark the Evangelist, the author of the second gospel account, is symbolized by a winged lion – a figure of courage and monarchy. The lion also represents Jesus' resurrection (because lions were believed to sleep with open eyes, a comparison with Christ in the tomb), and Christ as king. This signifies that Christians should be courageous on the path of salvation.
