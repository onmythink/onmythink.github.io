HYPERBOLE POEM
What Am I?
I'm bigger than the entire earth
More powerful than the sea
Though a million, billion have tried
Not one could ever stop me
I control each person with my hand
and hold up fleets of ships.
I can make them bend to my will
with one word from my lips.
I'm the greatest power in the world
in this entire nation,
No one should ever try to stop
a child's imagination</a>

What has hands and a face, but can’t hold anything or smile?
If you don’t keep me, I’ll break. What am I?
I go all around the world, but never leave the corner. What am I?
I make a loud sound when I’m changing. When I do change, I get bigger but weigh less. What am I?
It does not have a body. The numbers on each face sums up to 21 and are referred as eyes but you cannot see
What is inanimate, yet can stand up,
Can start out copper and end up as steel,
So fragile, a child could break one,
But many have the strength to lift a man?
What is it?
I'm not really more than holes tied to more holes; I'm strong as good steel, though not as stiff as a pole.
They can be harbored, but few hold water. You can nurse them, but only by holding them against someone else. You can carry them, but not with your arms. You can bury them, but not in the earth.
Curtail me thrice, I am a youth;
Behead me once, a snake;
Complete, I'm often used, in truth,
When certain steps you'd take.
What Am I?
Break it and it gets better, Immideatly set and harder to break again.

HYPERBOLE POEM
What Am I?
I'm bigger than the entire earth
More powerful than the sea

and hold up fleets of ships.

with one word from my lips.
I'm the greatest power in the world
in this entire nation,
No one should ever try to stop

I go all around the world, but never leave the corner. What am I?
I make a loud sound when I’m changing. When I do change, I get bigger but weigh less. What am I?
It does not have a body. The numbers on each face sums up to 21 and are referred as eyes but you cannot see
What is inanimate, yet can stand up,
Can start out copper and end up as steel,
So fragile, a child could break one,
But many have the strength to lift a man?
What is it?
I'm not really more than holes tied to more holes; I'm strong as good steel, though not as stiff as a pole.
They can be harbored, but few hold water. You can nurse them, but only by holding them against someone else. You can carry them, but not with your arms. You can bury them, but not in the earth.
Curtail me thrice, I am a youth;
Behead me once, a snake;
Complete, I'm often used, in truth,
When certain steps you'd take.
What Am I?
Break it and it gets better, Immideatly set and harder to break again.
