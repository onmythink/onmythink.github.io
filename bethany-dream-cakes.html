                                            Erik rang his grandparents' doorbell and silently wished the next fourhours would go by quickly. He didn't want to give up his entire Saturdayafternoon at his grandparents' house where there were no kids in theneighborhood."You're right on time," Grandma Bethany said, opening the door. "There'stea and cake in the dining room."Cake? At least the first ten minutes would go by quickly. Erik hung hiscoat on the rack by the door and saw a strange looking key hanging on a hook."Grandpa Bill, what's this funny key for?""That's a skeleton key. It opens the best room in this house," Grandpa Billwhispered so no one else could hear. "It's the room I go to when yourgrandmother tries to make me help with the dishes.""What's so special about the room?" Erik asked"It's a game room," Grandpa Bill said. "Take the key and see if you can findthe room by the time I finish my tea."Erik grabbed the key and stared at it. "A skeleton key? It looks old." Erikdecided the oldest things in the house were probably upstairs in the walk-upattic. He headed past the dining room and to the stairs.Grandpa Bill sipped his tea and shook his head.Erik knew that meant he was going the wrong way. He headed back to thefront door where he'd found the key.Erik thought about the oldest part of a house. "The basement! It's thefirst part that's built." He rushed to the basement door and looked at the lock.It was different from a normal lock. He slid the key inside and turned it. Witha click, the door opened.Erik switched on the light and walked down the stairs. The basement wasone giant room with a pool table in the middle and a dartboard on the far wall.* Awesome!" Erik said"Ever learn to play pool?" Grandpa Bill asked, coming down the stairs"No," Erik said"Well then, grab a cue from the rack and I'll teach you."Erik smiled. The next four hours were going to fly by1. What is the setting of the story? 2. Why didn't Erik want to visit his grandparents' house at the beginning of the story? 3. According to Grandpa, what can the skeleton key open? 4. Why did Erik think the key would open the attic door? 5. If given the chance, how would you end the story?​</a>

                                            According to grandpa what can the skeleton key open
Erik rang his grandparents’ doorbell and silently wished
the next four hours would go by quickly. He didn’t want to give
up his entire Saturday afternoon at his grandparents’ house
where there were no kids in the neighborhood.
“You’re right on time,” Grandma Bethany said, opening
the door. “There’s tea and cake in the dining room.”
Cake? At least the first ten minutes would go by quickly. Erik hung his coat on the rack by
the door and saw a strange looking key hanging on a hook. “Grandpa Bill, what’s this funny key
for?”
“That’s a skeleton key. It opens the best room in this house,” Grandpa Bill whispered so no
one else could hear. “It’s the room I go to when your grandmother tries to make me help with the
dishes.”
“What’s so special about the room?” Erik asked.
“It’s a game room,” Grandpa Bill said. “Take the key and see if you can find the room by
the time I finish my tea.”
Erik grabbed the key and stared at it. “A skeleton key? It looks old.” Erik decided the oldest
things in the house were probably upstairs in the walk-up attic. He headed past the dining room and to the stairs</a>

According to Matthew 27:55-56, Mary Magdalene and the other women had followed Jesus fromGalilee to the crucifixion site.17. According to John 19:25, Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Jesus, were the only womenstanding by the cross during the crucifixion of Christ.18.

Ivanka lives two floors above Sanjay and Sanjay lives 5 floors below bethany. On the floor  which is 8/9 of the way to the top of the building you will find a pool used by residents of the building.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To begin, we must determine how many floors there are in Friendly Towers. We
</p><p>are given that the number of floors is 5 times Dieter’s floor number. Thus,
</p><p>Friendly Towers has 5 × 9 = 45 floors.
</p><p>Bethany lives 3 floors from the top floor. Since 45 − 3 = 42, she lives on the 42nd
</p><p>floor.
</p><p>Sanjay lives 5 floors below Bethany. Since 42 − 5 = 37, he lives on the 37th floor.
</p><p>Ivanka lives 2 floors above Sanjay. Since 37 + 2 = 39, she lives on the 39th floor.
</p><p>The pool is 8
