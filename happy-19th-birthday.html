                        <p>The 17th century was the century that lasted from January 1, 1601, to December 31, 1700. It falls into the Early Modern period of Europe and in that continent (whose impact on the world was increasing) was characterized by the Baroque cultural movement, the latter part of the Spanish Golden Age, the Dutch Golden Age, the French Grand Siècle dominated by Louis XIV, the Scientific Revolution, the world's first public company and megacorporation known as the Dutch East India Company, and according to some historians, the General Crisis. The greatest military conflicts were the Thirty Years' War,[1] the Great Turkish War, Mughal–Safavid Wars (Mughal–Safavid War (1622–23), Mughal–Safavid War (1649–53)), Mughal-Maratha Wars, and the Dutch-Portuguese War. It was during this period also that European colonization of the Americas began in earnest, including the exploitation of the silver deposits, which resulted in bouts of inflation as wealth was drawn into Europe.[2]

                            29. 19th century women accessories?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Other than the type of clothing, fashion is also always related to <strong>hairstyles and accessories</strong> that can support appearance. The nineteenth century saw the peak of the popularity of several accessories, such as <strong>brooches, chain-linked watches, gloves, and monocles, as well as some hairstyles.</strong> But among some accessories and hairstyles, <strong>sideburns, buns, and hats</strong> became the hallmark of nineteenth-century fashion.</p><p></p><p>Similar to sideburns, the bun became the "identity" of women's fashion in the nineteenth century. There are various kinds of buns, but the most famous is the <strong>Apollo Bun</strong>, which is inspired by the hairstyles of <strong>ancient Greek and Roman women.</strong></p><p></p><p>Sideburns for men and buns for women became the most popular styles in the nineteenth century. Sideburns are even said to be the "identity" and differentiator of the nineteenth century from other centuries. This century is a golden age for various styles of sideburns because men consider them masculine. But after entering the twentieth century, sideburns lost their popularity.</p><p></p><p>In addition to styling their hair in various styles, men and women in the nineteenth century also enjoyed wearing accessories on their heads. One of my favorites is the <strong>hat</strong>. Various types and sizes of hats became popular in this century, for example <strong>bowler, deerstalker, and gainsborough.</strong> The first two types of hats were hats for men. Bowler first appeared in 1850 and was addressed to men who dress elegant. This hat is available in gray, brown, or black. Unlike the bowler used in casual events, the deerstalker is used more when exercising. This hat, which was popular from 1870 to 1890, was usually worn with norfolk and knickerbocker to play tennis, a popular sport in that century.</p><p></p><p>As a complement to fashion in addition to accessories, <strong>shoes also play an important role</strong>. Not too many important changes in the development of the nineteenth century shoe. Some shoes, such as boots, buttoned-shoes, and sandals, have been around for centuries and have not received much development. However, the development of sports activities in this century encouraged the production of special sports shoes. Rubber shoes were then produced for sports.</p><p></p><p>Let's see more about 19th and 20th century fashions here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17825040</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
