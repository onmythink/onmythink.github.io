Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The period of American colonialization of the Philippines lasted 48 years, from cession of the Philippines to the U.S. by Spain in 1898 to U.S. recognition of Philippine independence in 1946. America then held the Philippines until granting full independence on July 4, 1946.</p><p>2. After 300 years of passivity under Spanish rule, the Filipino spirit reawakened when 3 priests Gomez, Burgos, Zamora were guillotined without sufficient evidence of guilt. This occured on the 17th of February.</p><p>3.The Enlightenment helped combat the excesses of the church, establish science as a source of knowledge, and defend human rights against tyranny. It also gave us modern schooling, medicine, republics, representative democracy, and much more.</p><p>4. Philippine Literature, like many other fields, was greatly changed during the Enlightenment, a period during which independent though was embraced, skepticism ran freely through work, and new values, including an emphasis on science, became quite common among the educated classes.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.
