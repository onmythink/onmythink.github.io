Write your answer in your notebook. Wristwatches became popular in the 1920's. The first ones to be used were self-winding. Then in the 1950's, battery-operated wristwatches were manufactured and sold in the market. Powered by quartz crystals, electronic watches of today vibrate in their natural frequency. There are also digital quartz watches that display time in numbers. Their battery is either LED which stands for light-emitting diodes or LCD for liquid crystal display What kind of wristwatch do you use? Is it a self-winding one or electronic? Is it digital or the conventional one with the hour hand and the minute hand? Whichever it may be, watches and clocks are counting mechanisms that measure the passage of time and further help you follow your timetable. 1. You've got a new wristwatch which is similar to my two-year-old timepiece. 2. The clock hands and numerals are luminous or light-emitting for they glow even in darkest place. 3. Self-winding watches became popular in the 1920's so did automatic clocks. 4. The schedule of flights to the south is as tight as the timetable of sea trips. 5. Celebrating a fiesta is a time-honored Filipino tradition that dates back as a long-established Spanish culture centuries ago.​</a>

Write what level have you jump off
REMARKS
Write win or loss
Example
All players in a team to jump over the height of the piled hands of the opposing team.
Mechanics of the game:
 Two players on the base will sit facing each other with their right feet touching. 
The jumpers jump over the feet. 
Then one hand is placed above the feet with palms and fingers open,

FIRST CLOCKSundials are the first time measuring devices known to man. Created originally in babylon over six thousand years ago, and developed into more functional state inAncient Egypt, sundials became extremely useful analogue clock device the remainedin continual use for many thousands of years after, even managing to survive untiltoday. The true beginning of sundial popularity in Egypt started with the creation offirst obelisks – the tall and slim stone structure whose shadow enabled easy reading oftime from circular segmented horizontal disc that was placed on the ground around it.Sundials became obsolete for governments and commerce industry that was in mid-1800s.With such powerful tool, Egyptians discovered longest and shortest days, theexact point of "midday," and the reason why they were able to introduce the 10-hourdaylight system. Sundials eventually reached the Greek and Roman empires where theywere welcomed and improved dramatically, enabling the creation of much smaller andportable sundials. Because of their precision and reliability in sunny weather, sundialsremained in use even while Europe was going through the innovative phase ofdeveloping mechanical clocks. When those mechanical clocks finally provided accuratemeasurements of time, only then did​</a>

Two players on the base will sit facing each other with their right feet touching. 2.	The jumpers jump over their feet. 3.	Then one hand is placed above the feet with palms and fingers open, 4.	 then another, and so on until all the fingers are piled one on top of the other. 5.	Repeat the mechanics when your opponent’s turn. Supply 5 appropriate words that complete the thought of each word in the paragraph that you have read. 1. Popular- _______________________ 2.

FIRST CLOCKSundials are the first time measuring devices known to man. Created originally in babylon over six thousand years ago, and developed into more functional state inAncient Egypt, sundials became extremely useful analogue clock device the remainedin continual use for many thousands of years after, even managing to survive untiltoday. The true beginning of sundial popularity in Egypt started with the creation offirst obelisks – the tall and slim stone structure whose shadow enabled easy reading oftime from circular segmented horizontal disc that was placed on the ground around it.Sundials became obsolete for governments and commerce industry that was in mid-1800s.With such powerful tool, Egyptians discovered longest and shortest days, theexact point of "midday," and the reason why they were able to introduce the 10-hourdaylight system. Sundials eventually reached the Greek and Roman empires where theywere welcomed and improved dramatically, enabling the creation of much smaller andportable sundials. Because of their precision and reliability in sunny weather, sundialsremained in use even while Europe was going through the innovative phase ofdeveloping mechanical clocks.

Situating the review in a developmental systems framework, we synthesize evidence from the learning sciences and several branches of educational research regarding well-vetted strategies that support the kinds of relationships and learning opportunities needed to promote children’s well-being, healthy development, and transferable learning. In addition, we review research regarding practices that can help educators respond to individual variability, address adversity, and support resilience, such that schools can enable all children to find positive pathways to adulthood.</strong></p><p></p><br />
