                    <p>I’m very ugly
So don’t try to convince me that
I am a very beautiful person
Because at the end of the day
I hate myself in every single way
And I’m not going to lie to myself by saying
There is beauty inside of me that matters
That I am a worthless, terrible person
And nothing you say will make me believe
I still deserve love
Because no matter what
I am not good enough to be loved
And I am in no position to believe that
Beauty does exist within me
Because whenever I look in the mirror I always think
Am I as ugly as people say?

                                            The Good Prince Bantugan An old king ruled over the kingdom of Bumbaran. His kingdom was prosperous, his people were good;; and he should have been very happy. But the king was not contented. His heart was full of envy toward his younger brother, Prince Bantugan. Every time someone praised Prince Bantugan, the king frowned and looked angry. "Prince Bantugan is so handsome," he often heard the women say, and he would look in a mirror and see with sorrow that he was not good-looking. "Prince Bantugan is so good, other people said, and the king grew more angrily because he knew that he was not as good as his brother either. "Prince Bantugan is so brave," everybody said. The king grew tired of people saying so many good things about his brother while they said nothing nice about him. The young ladies smiled at Prince Bantugan. They allowed him to hold their hands. and they gave him their love. But they did not like the older brother, the king. One day enemies attacked the kingdom of Bumbaran, and Prince Bantugan led his soldiers to defend the country. While he was gone, the evil king plotted against the good prince. He issued a proclamation that no one should speak to Prince Bantugan. He added that whoever dared to speak to Bantugan would be killed. Soon Prince Bantugan returned victorious from the battle. To his astonishment no one met him, no one praised him, and no one even wanted to speak to him. This saddened the good prince. He knew that his brother hated him, so he decided to leave Bumbaran. He preferred to live in other countries and to travel to far lands and forget about his unkind brother. In his travels he heard about the beautiful land of the Kingdom-Between-Two- Seas. It was ruled by a good, kind king and his sister, the beautiful and kind Princess Datimbang. Prince Bantugan decided to go there. He traveled through forests and across rivers and mountains and at last reached the Kingdom-Between-Two-Seas. Prince Bantugan became very weary from his travels. As he stood outside the gates of the great palace, he suddenly felt very weak. His legs could not carry his body, and the prince fell to the ground and died. The parrot flew ahead to the kingdom of Bumbaran. When he told the king about the death of Prince Bantugan, the ladies shrieked and tore their hair and fainted. Everyone grieved for the Good Prince Bantugan. Even the king, his brother, was stricken with remorse and pain. He was full of repentance. He blamed himself for the death of his brother. He did not know what to do. Prince Madali was brother of Prince Bantugan and loved him dearly. He volunteered to go to the region of the dead and bring Bantugan's soul back to his body. The king decided to go with him. It was a very dangerous journey, but the two were not afraid. They rode on their magic shields and rode up to the sky. For five days they flew. They reached the place of lightning, thunder, and endless rain. Five more days they travelled. They reached the land of burning heat. Their magic shields almost melted under them. So great was the distance that they went on for five more days. At last they reached the highest portals of the sky. The keeper of the gate asked them, "Why are you here? What do you want? "We have come to ask the angel of Death when we shall die and when the end of the world will come," the young man answered. "Go to the next door," the gatekeeper told them. "You will find the angel who guards the soul of the dead there." "Why are you here?" asked the guard. "You have no business here." You are not dead." "We have come to ask the Angel of Death when we shall die." Prince Madali answered. "Come in but only for a minute," the guardian said opening the door. "Then you must return to earth right away." The two entered and found themselves in a beautiful garden full of fragrant flowers and delicious fruits. On a large table were bottles of different colors which contained the souls of the dead. The two tricked the Angel of Death to go out for a minute. As soon as the angel was out of the room, Prince Madali whispered softly, "Bantugan, my brother where are you?" am From a large blue bottle near them, the voice of Prince Bantugan answered, "I here." Prince Madali seized the bottle and away the young men flew back to earth. When they reached the palace, the king and the princess of the Kingdom- Between Two Seas were just landing with the body of Prince Bantugan. Prince Madali transferred the soul of Prince Bantugan from the bottle to his body. The body stirred. Then Prince Bantugan sat up and stretched out as if just awakening from a deep sleep. The people shouted with joy. For many days they celebrated the return of their beloved prince. Later, Prince Bantugan married the beautiful Princess Datimbang Character traitstittle:trait/evidence:trait/evidence:trait/evidence:​</a>

                                            alin din ang introduction Instruction: Watch the movie 200 Pounds Beauty (2006) Afterwards, answer the following questions: 1. Describe the physical self of the main character (1) at the beginning of the movie, and at the of the movie. The main character Kang Han-na is an extremely overweight woman that is a ghost singer for a popular singer and a phone sex operator. She has a wonderful voice but not attractive enough to be considered. The main character physical appearance changed because she did a plastic surgery that is most of korean's ways to improve their self confidence and to be considered as a person. Han na did a head to toe plastic surgery, her eyes were steady to attractive eyes, nose from a huge to pointed one, lips were not different much, but her face totally changed her facial shape from rounded to oval. The body changed a lot because it really is the main reason of everyone to lose their confidence, her body went from obese and plump to petite, a dainty gorgeous woman although she really was beautiful when she was her true self. 2. What is the climax of the story? How does this turning point appeal to you? The climax of the story is when the overweight woman emerges pretty and slender. The main character decided to use South Korea's tool to boost a confidence and to be "accepted" by people that is plastic surgery. She chose to make herself different from before for the sake of her "crush" or the man she wanted so badly and also to be recognize. This story appeal to me in various ways, one is when she was down because some of her so called friends literally shows no support or even made her feel down, I somehow experience that situation and it really is diminishing in self confidence. Also the climax affects me when she finally boost her confidence when everyone started to compliment and admire her beauty, myself somehow relate in that situation, I am the kind of person who doesn't like to be complimented all the time but once someone does it genuinely makes me happy which helps me to gain and improve my self image. ff. Based on the entire narrative and on the ending, what kind of beauty is prescribed or supported by the film? Explain your answer. In my opinion, the movie prescribes an exotic kind of beauty because it tackles the body composition and the facial features itself, It describes how one based on the physical appearance and not on the personality, most people nowadays are like this, they admire a person just by their looks which is totally normal and fine but it is more admirable when someone looks deeper into the person's character. The lesson I've learned from this movie is simply plastic surgery is a truely a choice but it is different on why you would do it is it because it helps yourself to be more confident and build up your self worth or because of social pressure. Loving who you truely are plays a big factor on accepting your flaws and once you did everything falls in to the right places.​</a>

Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit. question?

However, the god also predicted that their perfection was not meant to last A short time after this prophecy, Eurydice had been wandering in the forest with other Nymphs.

                                            The Legend of Marinduque Retold by: Alfonso P. Santos (Marinduque, Southern Luzon) - - - - - - - In a small island kingdom there once lived a very beautiful princess. She was nicknamed Maring. Her favorite haunt was the top of a very tall mountain, Mount Malindig. She was very fond of hunting wild animals, a diversion which was much against her father’s wish. One day she espied a pretty white deer. It ran so swiftly that it took her a long time to catch up with it. She had the game already at bay when the owner came along looking for it. The stranger was a man of princely bearing and fine manners. He introduced himself as Duque and the deer to her as offered a token of their first meeting. Maring could not resist his gallant gesture. She could not help admiring the stranger, who fell in love with her at first sight. Since that day they often met in the forest. The beauty of Maring was known far and wide. Innumerable suitors came to woo her, but she turned a deaf ear to them all, for she had set her heart on the modest Duque. Not knowing about her secret love affair, her royal father announced that her hand would be given to the one who would win a ship race. So the most persistent suitors, three wealthy kings, fitted out vessels for the contest. Duque could not participate. He was not rich enough to equip a vessel. Meanwhile, Maring was very unhappy. She prayed to the gods for help. Bathala heard her prayers. On the appointed day, the sky grew suddenly dark. The sea seethed turbulently and the winds blew furiously, but the contest could not be put off for another day. The three kings set forth bravely on their ships. Before they were halfway to the goal, one of them hit a rock and soon vanished from sight with his ship. The second vessel was able to move on a little farther and then it was also devour by the angry sea. The last ship met the same fate. The king and the spectators grieved over the fate of the three royal suitors. Only Maring did not feel grieved at the outcome of the race. When the sea calmed down, everyone was surprised to see three islands at the places where the ship had sunk. They were named Tres Reyes, or Three Kings, after the unlucky trio. The father of Maring did not wish to sacrifice more lives after that disaster. He gave his daughter freedom to choose her husband. So she confessed to him her secret love. The king consisted to the marriage. Seven days of feasting and merrymaking followed. To mark the happy union of the two young people, the island kingdom was named Marinduque, after Maring and Duque.1.what is the begging of the story? 2.what is the ending of the story3.what have you learn about the story?​</a>

                                            What I Can Do Read the story and do what is asked. The Legend of the Lizard Long ago, there was a mother who loved her only son deeply. She was a pious woman and her son imitated most of her good deeds, which were many. Her son was good at heart, but young. The woman knew that he still had much to learn before he could fully adopt saintly ways. God decided to test this young son's piety and love for his mother. He sent a beautiful woman to capture the young man's eager heart. The beautiful woman urged the son to keep their meetings a secret from his mother, and though it pained the boy to do so, for he never kept secrets from his mother, he obeyed. But the real challenge had not yet been failed. The beautiful woman beguiled the boy so that she was able to make him promise that he would do anything she asked. She therefore asked that he should - if he loved her as truly as he declared - cut out his mother's heart and bring it to her. The young man, blinded by love, dutifully slaughtered his beloved mother. It was exactly six o'clock in the evening, and his mother was reciting the Angelus then. He held the still beating heart in his hands as he rushed to where he knew the girl stood waiting. But when he got to their meeting-place, the girl was not there. Nothing was there - save for the realization of what he had done. The heart still beat, though it tarried long in the hands of the prodigal son. And then it began to speak. In his shock, the boy dropped the heart, and it fell into a crack in the ground. "Are you in pain, my child?" the mother's heart inquired. "Let me sing you a lullaby, to soothe you to sleep." The heart softly started singing, as lovingly as its owner would have done. And in the son's remorse he fell flat on his belly and kissed the ground that the heart lay on. The boy was so filled with guilt and grief that he did not notice himself changing, growing smaller, losing all his hair and clothing so that he was a tiny web-footed thing, that kissed and kissed at the ground as if begging for someone's forgiveness. At exactly six o'clock every night, when the Angelus strikes, the lizard comes down from the walls of the house, and crawls down to the floor, where it would make slight ticking sounds like quick kisses. It has been said that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and that with its tiny ears it could hear an ancient beating, and a lullaby that does not end Directions: After reading a story, write about how the story is similar or different from your own life by using the questions in the chart.

Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit.pls summarize this pls ​</a>

                                            Orpheus and Eurydice The Myth of Orpheus and Eurydice One time, when Orpheus was playing his lyre in nature, his eyes fell upon a beautiful wood nymph. Her name was Eurydice and she had been drawn to Orpheus by the beauty of his music and voice. The two of them fell in love instantly, unable to spend a single moment apart. After a while, they got married and Hymenaios, the god of marriage, blessed their union. However, the god also predicted that their perfection was not meant to last. A short time after this prophecy, Eurydice had been wandering in the forest with other Nymphs. Aristaeus, a shepherd dwelling nearby, had devised a plan to conquer the beautiful nymph since he deeply hated Orpheus. He set an ambush for them in the middle of the forest, and as they approached, he jumped on them in order to kill Orpheus. As the shepherd made his move, Orpheus grabbed Eurydice by the hand and started running through the forest. Few steps away, Eurydice had stepped on a nest of snakes and had been bitten by a deadly viper, instantly dying. Aristaeus had abandoned his try, cursing his luck. Orpheus sang his deep grief with his lyre and managed to move everything, living or not, in the world; both humans and gods learned about his sorrow and grief. And so Orpheus decided to descend to Hades in order to bring his wife back to life. Being a demigod, he could enter the realm of the dead, passing by souls and ghosts of people unknown. With his music, he also managed to enchant Cerberus, the three-headed dog that guarded the gates of the Underworld He later presented himself in front of the god of the Underworld, Hades, and his wife Persephone. Even the Gods could not neglect the pain in his voice, and so Hades told Orpheus that he could take Eurydice with him but under one condition: she would have to follow him while walking out to the light from the caves of the underworld, but he should not look at her before coming out to the light or else he might lose her forever. If he was patient, Eurydice would become his once more. Orpheus thought that this was an easy task for a patient man like himself, and so he accepted the terms and began the ascend back into the world of the living. However, just before reaching the exit of the Underworld, and being unable to hear his wife’s footsteps, he feared that the gods had fooled him. In the end, Orpheus lost his faith and turned to see Eurydice behind him, but her shade was thrown back among the dead once more, now trapped with Hades forever. Answer the following questions. 1. How did Eurydice die? 2. How did Orpheus get Eurydice from the underworld? 3. What happened to Eurydice after Orpheus retrieved her?​</a>

                            4. The Good Prince Bantugan An old king ruled over the kingdom of Bumbaran. His kingdom was prosperous, his people were good;; and he should have been very happy. But the king was not contented. His heart was full of envy toward his younger brother, Prince Bantugan. Every time someone praised Prince Bantugan, the king frowned and looked angry. "Prince Bantugan is so handsome," he often heard the women say, and he would look in a mirror and see with sorrow that he was not good-looking. "Prince Bantugan is so good, other people said, and the king grew more angrily because he knew that he was not as good as his brother either. "Prince Bantugan is so brave," everybody said. The king grew tired of people saying so many good things about his brother while they said nothing nice about him. The young ladies smiled at Prince Bantugan. They allowed him to hold their hands. and they gave him their love. But they did not like the older brother, the king. One day enemies attacked the kingdom of Bumbaran, and Prince Bantugan led his soldiers to defend the country. While he was gone, the evil king plotted against the good prince. He issued a proclamation that no one should speak to Prince Bantugan. He added that whoever dared to speak to Bantugan would be killed. Soon Prince Bantugan returned victorious from the battle. To his astonishment no one met him, no one praised him, and no one even wanted to speak to him. This saddened the good prince. He knew that his brother hated him, so he decided to leave Bumbaran. He preferred to live in other countries and to travel to far lands and forget about his unkind brother. In his travels he heard about the beautiful land of the Kingdom-Between-Two- Seas. It was ruled by a good, kind king and his sister, the beautiful and kind Princess Datimbang. Prince Bantugan decided to go there. He traveled through forests and across rivers and mountains and at last reached the Kingdom-Between-Two-Seas. Prince Bantugan became very weary from his travels. As he stood outside the gates of the great palace, he suddenly felt very weak. His legs could not carry his body, and the prince fell to the ground and died. The parrot flew ahead to the kingdom of Bumbaran. When he told the king about the death of Prince Bantugan, the ladies shrieked and tore their hair and fainted. Everyone grieved for the Good Prince Bantugan. Even the king, his brother, was stricken with remorse and pain. He was full of repentance. He blamed himself for the death of his brother. He did not know what to do. Prince Madali was brother of Prince Bantugan and loved him dearly. He volunteered to go to the region of the dead and bring Bantugan's soul back to his body. The king decided to go with him. It was a very dangerous journey, but the two were not afraid. They rode on their magic shields and rode up to the sky. For five days they flew. They reached the place of lightning, thunder, and endless rain. Five more days they travelled. They reached the land of burning heat. Their magic shields almost melted under them. So great was the distance that they went on for five more days. At last they reached the highest portals of the sky. The keeper of the gate asked them, "Why are you here? What do you want? "We have come to ask the angel of Death when we shall die and when the end of the world will come," the young man answered. "Go to the next door," the gatekeeper told them. "You will find the angel who guards the soul of the dead there." "Why are you here?" asked the guard. "You have no business here." You are not dead." "We have come to ask the Angel of Death when we shall die." Prince Madali answered. "Come in but only for a minute," the guardian said opening the door. "Then you must return to earth right away." The two entered and found themselves in a beautiful garden full of fragrant flowers and delicious fruits. On a large table were bottles of different colors which contained the souls of the dead. The two tricked the Angel of Death to go out for a minute. As soon as the angel was out of the room, Prince Madali whispered softly, "Bantugan, my brother where are you?" am From a large blue bottle near them, the voice of Prince Bantugan answered, "I here." Prince Madali seized the bottle and away the young men flew back to earth. When they reached the palace, the king and the princess of the Kingdom- Between Two Seas were just landing with the body of Prince Bantugan. Prince Madali transferred the soul of Prince Bantugan from the bottle to his body. The body stirred. Then Prince Bantugan sat up and stretched out as if just awakening from a deep sleep. The people shouted with joy. For many days they celebrated the return of their beloved prince. Later, Prince Bantugan married the beautiful Princess Datimbang Character traitstittle:trait/evidence:trait/evidence:trait/evidence:​</h2><br />

                            5. alin din ang introduction Instruction: Watch the movie 200 Pounds Beauty (2006) Afterwards, answer the following questions: 1. Describe the physical self of the main character (1) at the beginning of the movie, and at the of the movie. The main character Kang Han-na is an extremely overweight woman that is a ghost singer for a popular singer and a phone sex operator. She has a wonderful voice but not attractive enough to be considered. The main character physical appearance changed because she did a plastic surgery that is most of korean's ways to improve their self confidence and to be considered as a person. Han na did a head to toe plastic surgery, her eyes were steady to attractive eyes, nose from a huge to pointed one, lips were not different much, but her face totally changed her facial shape from rounded to oval. The body changed a lot because it really is the main reason of everyone to lose their confidence, her body went from obese and plump to petite, a dainty gorgeous woman although she really was beautiful when she was her true self. 2. What is the climax of the story? How does this turning point appeal to you? The climax of the story is when the overweight woman emerges pretty and slender. The main character decided to use South Korea's tool to boost a confidence and to be "accepted" by people that is plastic surgery. She chose to make herself different from before for the sake of her "crush" or the man she wanted so badly and also to be recognize. This story appeal to me in various ways, one is when she was down because some of her so called friends literally shows no support or even made her feel down, I somehow experience that situation and it really is diminishing in self confidence. Also the climax affects me when she finally boost her confidence when everyone started to compliment and admire her beauty, myself somehow relate in that situation, I am the kind of person who doesn't like to be complimented all the time but once someone does it genuinely makes me happy which helps me to gain and improve my self image. ff. Based on the entire narrative and on the ending, what kind of beauty is prescribed or supported by the film? Explain your answer. In my opinion, the movie prescribes an exotic kind of beauty because it tackles the body composition and the facial features itself, It describes how one based on the physical appearance and not on the personality, most people nowadays are like this, they admire a person just by their looks which is totally normal and fine but it is more admirable when someone looks deeper into the person's character. The lesson I've learned from this movie is simply plastic surgery is a truely a choice but it is different on why you would do it is it because it helps yourself to be more confident and build up your self worth or because of social pressure. Loving who you truely are plays a big factor on accepting your flaws and once you did everything falls in to the right places.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Thank you for the summary of the movie "200 Pounds Beauty". Based on the narrative and ending of the movie, the kind of beauty that is prescribed or supported by the film is physical beauty. The movie portrays physical beauty as a means of gaining acceptance and success in society, as the main character's transformation leads to her achieving her dreams and winning the affection of her crush. The movie also suggests that plastic surgery is a viable solution for individuals who are not considered physically attractive, as it can provide a way to change one's appearance and gain confidence. However, it is important to note that the movie does not promote or support the idea of using plastic surgery to conform to societal standards of beauty or to meet others' expectations. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of self-love and acceptance, and the need to focus on inner qualities rather than just physical appearance.</p><br />

Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election.

She was nicknamed Maring. Her favorite haunt was the top of a very tall mountain, Mount Malindig. She was very fond of hunting wild animals, a diversion which was much against her father’s wish. One day she espied a pretty white deer. It ran so swiftly that it took her a long time to catch up with it. She had the game already at bay when the owner came along looking for it. The stranger was a man of princely bearing and fine manners. He introduced himself as Duque and the deer to her as offered a token of their first meeting. Maring could not resist his gallant gesture. She could not help admiring the stranger, who fell in love with her at first sight. Since that day they often met in the forest. The beauty of Maring was known far and wide. Innumerable suitors came to woo her, but she turned a deaf ear to them all, for she had set her heart on the modest Duque. Not knowing about her secret love affair, her royal father announced that her hand would be given to the one who would win a ship race. So the most persistent suitors, three wealthy kings, fitted out vessels for the contest. Duque could not participate. He was not rich enough to equip a vessel. Meanwhile, Maring was very unhappy. She prayed to the gods for help. Bathala heard her prayers. On the appointed day, the sky grew suddenly dark. The sea seethed turbulently and the winds blew furiously, but the contest could not be put off for another day. The three kings set forth bravely on their ships. Before they were halfway to the goal, one of them hit a rock and soon vanished from sight with his ship. The second vessel was able to move on a little farther and then it was also devour by the angry sea. The last ship met the same fate. The king and the spectators grieved over the fate of the three royal suitors. Only Maring did not feel grieved at the outcome of the race. When the sea calmed down, everyone was surprised to see three islands at the places where the ship had sunk. They were named Tres Reyes, or Three Kings, after the unlucky trio. The father of Maring did not wish to sacrifice more lives after that disaster. He gave his daughter freedom to choose her husband. So she confessed to him her secret love. The king consisted to the marriage. Seven days of feasting and merrymaking followed.

                            19. What I Can Do Read the story and do what is asked. The Legend of the Lizard Long ago, there was a mother who loved her only son deeply. She was a pious woman and her son imitated most of her good deeds, which were many. Her son was good at heart, but young. The woman knew that he still had much to learn before he could fully adopt saintly ways. God decided to test this young son's piety and love for his mother. He sent a beautiful woman to capture the young man's eager heart. The beautiful woman urged the son to keep their meetings a secret from his mother, and though it pained the boy to do so, for he never kept secrets from his mother, he obeyed. But the real challenge had not yet been failed. The beautiful woman beguiled the boy so that she was able to make him promise that he would do anything she asked. She therefore asked that he should - if he loved her as truly as he declared - cut out his mother's heart and bring it to her. The young man, blinded by love, dutifully slaughtered his beloved mother. It was exactly six o'clock in the evening, and his mother was reciting the Angelus then. He held the still beating heart in his hands as he rushed to where he knew the girl stood waiting. But when he got to their meeting-place, the girl was not there. Nothing was there - save for the realization of what he had done. The heart still beat, though it tarried long in the hands of the prodigal son. And then it began to speak. In his shock, the boy dropped the heart, and it fell into a crack in the ground. "Are you in pain, my child?" the mother's heart inquired. "Let me sing you a lullaby, to soothe you to sleep." The heart softly started singing, as lovingly as its owner would have done. And in the son's remorse he fell flat on his belly and kissed the ground that the heart lay on. The boy was so filled with guilt and grief that he did not notice himself changing, growing smaller, losing all his hair and clothing so that he was a tiny web-footed thing, that kissed and kissed at the ground as if begging for someone's forgiveness. At exactly six o'clock every night, when the Angelus strikes, the lizard comes down from the walls of the house, and crawls down to the floor, where it would make slight ticking sounds like quick kisses. It has been said that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and that with its tiny ears it could hear an ancient beating, and a lullaby that does not end Directions: After reading a story, write about how the story is similar or different from your own life by using the questions in the chart.

                            24. 		Permit us to refresh your memory: what comes from heaven is always a blessing, the enemy is not the rain. Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit.pls summarize this pls ​</h2><br />

Nothing was there - save for the realization of what he had done. The heart still beat, though it tarried long in the hands of the prodigal son. And then it began to speak. In his shock, the boy dropped the heart, and it fell into a crack in the ground. "Are you in pain, my child?" the mother's heart inquired. "Let me sing you a lullaby, to soothe you to sleep." The heart softly started singing, as lovingly as its owner would have done. And in the son's remorse he fell flat on his belly and kissed the ground that the heart lay on. The boy was so filled with guilt and grief that he did not notice himself changing, growing smaller, losing all his hair and clothing so that he was a tiny web-footed thing, that kissed and kissed at the ground as if begging for someone's forgiveness. At exactly six o'clock every night, when the Angelus strikes, the lizard comes down from the walls of the house, and crawls down to the floor, where it would make slight ticking sounds like quick kisses. It has been said that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and that with its tiny ears it could hear an ancient beating, and a lullaby that does not end.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> The exposition of "Legend of the Lizard" is the introduction of the characters and the situation. In this story, the exposition is about a mother and her pious son who loves her deeply.</p><p></p><p>The complication of the story is when God tests the son's piety and love for his mother by sending a beautiful woman to beguile him. The woman makes the son promise to do anything she asks, and she asks him to cut out his mother's heart and bring it to her.</p><p></p><p>The climax of the story is when the son, blinded by love, obeys the woman and kills his own mother to fulfill his promise. He then holds his mother's heart in his hands as he rushes to meet the woman, only to find out that she is not there.</p><p></p><p>The denouement of the story is when the mother's heart speaks to the son and soothes him with a lullaby. The son is filled with guilt and grief, and he falls flat on his belly, kissing the ground for forgiveness. He then transforms into a tiny web-footed lizard that kisses the ground every day at exactly six o'clock when the Angelus strikes.</p><p></p><p>The resolution of the story is that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and it still hears the ancient beating and lullaby that does not end. The story ends with a sense of unresolved guilt and sorrow</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps you can mark me down as brainiest if you want  :&gt;</p><p>-CLARYNX</p><br />

                            27. Orpheus and Eurydice The Myth of Orpheus and Eurydice One time, when Orpheus was playing his lyre in nature, his eyes fell upon a beautiful wood nymph. Her name was Eurydice and she had been drawn to Orpheus by the beauty of his music and voice. The two of them fell in love instantly, unable to spend a single moment apart. After a while, they got married and Hymenaios, the god of marriage, blessed their union. However, the god also predicted that their perfection was not meant to last. A short time after this prophecy, Eurydice had been wandering in the forest with other Nymphs. Aristaeus, a shepherd dwelling nearby, had devised a plan to conquer the beautiful nymph since he deeply hated Orpheus. He set an ambush for them in the middle of the forest, and as they approached, he jumped on them in order to kill Orpheus. As the shepherd made his move, Orpheus grabbed Eurydice by the hand and started running through the forest. Few steps away, Eurydice had stepped on a nest of snakes and had been bitten by a deadly viper, instantly dying. Aristaeus had abandoned his try, cursing his luck. Orpheus sang his deep grief with his lyre and managed to move everything, living or not, in the world; both humans and gods learned about his sorrow and grief. And so Orpheus decided to descend to Hades in order to bring his wife back to life. Being a demigod, he could enter the realm of the dead, passing by souls and ghosts of people unknown. With his music, he also managed to enchant Cerberus, the three-headed dog that guarded the gates of the Underworld He later presented himself in front of the god of the Underworld, Hades, and his wife Persephone. Even the Gods could not neglect the pain in his voice, and so Hades told Orpheus that he could take Eurydice with him but under one condition: she would have to follow him while walking out to the light from the caves of the underworld, but he should not look at her before coming out to the light or else he might lose her forever. If he was patient, Eurydice would become his once more. Orpheus thought that this was an easy task for a patient man like himself, and so he accepted the terms and began the ascend back into the world of the living. However, just before reaching the exit of the Underworld, and being unable to hear his wife’s footsteps, he feared that the gods had fooled him. In the end, Orpheus lost his faith and turned to see Eurydice behind him, but her shade was thrown back among the dead once more, now trapped with Hades forever. Answer the following questions. 1. How did Eurydice die? 2. How did Orpheus get Eurydice from the underworld? 3. What happened to Eurydice after Orpheus retrieved her?​</h2><br />
