Answer the questions that follow.Taking Care of Our Oceans &lt;TittleHere's the short passage!      Oceans provide a home to amazing creatures like fish, marine mammals, sea reptiles, and coral. Oceans are a renewable source of food and power for humans, and they generate most of the planet's oxygen by supporting sea plants like kelp, algae, and plankton. Ocean also help to regulate global temperatures.       Unfortunately, althoug humans recieve many benifits from oceans, we are their biggest enemies, as consumers of energy and as pollutes. Have you thought about how your daily activities affect the healths of our oceans? Making simple changes in your routines can have a positive impact. Here are a few things you can do:• Dispose of trash properly. Don't litter on land or in a water!• Rexycle or reuse materials. Plastic bottles, including bottles, can be particularly harmful to oceans and to sea creatures. Use reusable foods or drink containers. Buy or make reusable shopping bags.• Reduce your "carbon footprints" (the amount of energy that you use from nonrenewable resources). Bike, walk, carpool, or take public transportation to work and school. Use energy-efficient lights and appliances, and turn them off when no one is using them.• Participate in a beach, river, or lake cleanup project.

                                            Direction:Within 20 minutes, Read and Answer the following:A.Taking Care of Our OceansOceans provide a home to amazing creatures like fish, marine mammals, sea reptiles, and coral. Oceans are a renewable source of food and power for humans, and they generate most of the planet's oxygen by supporting sea plants like kelp, algae, and plankton. Oceans also help to regulate global temperatures.Unfortunately, although humans receive many benefits from oceans, we are their biggest enemy, as consumers of energy and as polluters. Have you thought about how your daily activities affect the health of our oceans? Making simple changes in your routines can have a positive impact. Here are a few things you can do:• Dispose of trash properly. Don't litter on land or in water! • Recycle or reuse materials. Plastic items, including bottles, can be particularly harmful to oceans and to sea creatures. Use reusable food or drink containers. Buy or make reusable shopping bags.• Reduce your "carbon footprint" (the amount of energy that you use from nonrenewable sources). Bike, walk, carpool, or take public. transportation to work and school. Use energy-efficient lights and appliances, and turn them off when no one is using them.• Participate in a beach, river, or lake cleanup project. Or just pick up trash you see in these areas when you visit them.B.The Pacific Garbage PatchDid you know that water currents in the northern Pacific Ocean capture a huge amount of garbage? Plastic and other types of man-made waste float on the surface and circulate below the water. It is difficult to measure how much tranh is in the ocean because a lot of the trash has broken down into tiny pieces. As a result, this polluted region is more like "trash soup" than a solid "island of trash" that is easy to see. Some reports estimate that this area, known as the Pacific Garbage Patch, covers 700,000 square kilometers (270,000 square miles), while others say the area is an big as 15,000,000 square kilometers (5,800,000 square miles),The Pacific Garbage Patch causes many environmental concerns. The small pieces of plastic in the patch are called "microplastic"; they are hard to collect and clean up. Microplastic that escapes the garbage patch washes up on shores. In the United States, plastic pollution from the patch is a big problem in coastal Alaska. Also, finh and other creatures, like sea turtles and birds, think microplastic is food. Eating microplastic can harm animals; it can choke them, poison them, and affect their ability to reproduce. People also consume fish that have eaten microplastic, exposing them to harmful chemicals found in some plastic products.Questions:1. How would you describe the Pacific Garbage Patch?2. What are two kinds of sea plants that produce the oxygen in the air we breathe?3. What are two ways to reduce the amount of plastic waste that pollutes oceans?please answer this correctly with explanation please i need it i have pass tomorrow​</a>

Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</a>

Just like a birthday is a special day to celebrate a person Earth Day is a special daythat celebrates the Earth Earth Day was born on April 22, 1970 in San Francisco, California. Every year,America and over 100 different countries join together in the celebration of Earth Day on April 22nd Earth dayis the largest, most celebrated environmental event worldwide. On Earth Day, we rememeber to appreciatenature and learn ways to protect our environment. Find ways that you can help keep the planet clean andprotect our environment!schThe Earth is humongous, having the diameter of 7. 926 miles. It orbits around the sum of a speed of 18.5miles per second or 67,000 miles per hour. Seventy one percent of the Earth's surface is water: the PacificOcean makes up 70 million squared miles of that coverage. The force of gravity is strong that you would needto travel at a speed at least seven miles per second to escape it. Approximately two million species of animals,plants and other organisms have been identified and named: it is estimated that approximately 50 millionspecies have yet to be identified.If everyone in the United States recycled their newspapers, the lives of 41,000 tress woul be spared. Onesingle tree can detoxify the air of up of to 60 pounds of pollutants. To make an aluminum can from recycledmaterials takes only five percent of the energy normally needed to make acan, an energy savings Of 95%.The energy saved by recycling just one aluminum can is enough to power a television set for three hours.Recycling glass bottles allows the energy consumption for new glass products to be cut in half.Answer the comprehension check.1.

Plastic PollutionDid you know that every year 8 milliontons of plastic end up in our planet's beautifulblue oceans? And that's seriously bad newsfor our friends beneath the waves...Over 700 species of marineanimals have been reported to have eaten orbeen entangled in plastic - and scientiststhink that the amount of plastic in the oceanmay triple by 2050! But here is the good news – by understanding the issue andtaking action, you can help change the future and make our oceans a clean,safe place for our wonderful wildlife!The problem is that most of us use more plastic than we need to, and half ofthe plastic we produce is designed to be used just once and chucked away. Thisso-called 'single-use plastic is used to make all kinds of items, such as shoppingbags, straws, food wrappers and various packaging. And because plastictakes over 400 years to decompose (break down), it stays in the natural world,causing damage, for a very long time.Scientists think that a whopping 8.8 million tons of plastic end up in the oceanevery year. That is the same as stacking five plastic shopping bags of rubbishon top of each other on every meter of coastline in the world! But how does it allget there?One way is through 'ocean dumping, when people illegally tip largeamounts of waste directly into the sea. But not all plastic in the ocean is dumpedthere on purpose. In fact, around 80% plastic in the sea comes from the land...Animals and birds can get trapped, tangled, and even strangled by allkinds of plastic waste, such as discarded fishing nets and six-pack rings from drink cans.they also mistakes small bits of plastic such as bottle tops and wrappers for food and gobble them up leaving no room in their swollen thumb is for real food and the problem does not end there by working together our choices can help clean up the ocean and make it a safe place for our amazing marine life Questions:1.what type of informational/factual text is the passage above?a.expositoryb.factual descriptionc.factual recountd.persuasive2.what is the purpose of this type of text?a.to persuadeb.to entairtainc.to described.to narrate3.what kind of verb is the word"can" in the last paragraph?a.sensingb.linkingc.nounsd.action4.what part of speech are the parenthesis?"(whopping)8.8million,(shopping) bags,(amazing) marine life".a.adjectivesb.connectivesc.nounsd.verbs5.what part of speech are the following---pollution,news,ocean,scientists?a.adjectivesb.connectivesc.nounsd.verbsplsss answer my question i mark you as a brainliest and i give you 25 points​</a>

Oceans are a renewable source of food and power for humans, and they generate most of the planet's oxygen by supporting sea plants like kelp, algae, and plankton. Ocean also help to regulate global temperatures.       Unfortunately, althoug humans recieve many benifits from oceans, we are their biggest enemies, as consumers of energy and as pollutes. Have you thought about how your daily activities affect the healths of our oceans? Making simple changes in your routines can have a positive impact. Here are a few things you can do:• Dispose of trash properly. Don't litter on land or in a water!• Rexycle or reuse materials. Plastic bottles, including bottles, can be particularly harmful to oceans and to sea creatures. Use reusable foods or drink containers. Buy or make reusable shopping bags.• Reduce your "carbon footprints" (the amount of energy that you use from nonrenewable resources). Bike, walk, carpool, or take public transportation to work and school. Use energy-efficient lights and appliances, and turn them off when no one is using them.• Participate in a beach, river, or lake cleanup project. Or just pick up trash you see in those areas when you visit them.Source: https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resoucefiles/etf56pg45-52.pdf1. What is the main idea of the passage?2.

Oceans also help to regulate global temperatures.Unfortunately, although humans receive many benefits from oceans, we are their biggest enemy, as consumers of energy and as polluters. Have you thought about how your daily activities affect the health of our oceans? Making simple changes in your routines can have a positive impact.

Or just pick up trash you see in these areas when you visit them.B.The Pacific Garbage PatchDid you know that water currents in the northern Pacific Ocean capture a huge amount of garbage? Plastic and other types of man-made waste float on the surface and circulate below the water. It is difficult to measure how much tranh is in the ocean because a lot of the trash has broken down into tiny pieces. As a result, this polluted region is more like "trash soup" than a solid "island of trash" that is easy to see. Some reports estimate that this area, known as the Pacific Garbage Patch, covers 700,000 square kilometers (270,000 square miles), while others say the area is an big as 15,000,000 square kilometers (5,800,000 square miles),The Pacific Garbage Patch causes many environmental concerns. The small pieces of plastic in the patch are called "microplastic"; they are hard to collect and clean up. Microplastic that escapes the garbage patch washes up on shores. In the United States, plastic pollution from the patch is a big problem in coastal Alaska. Also, finh and other creatures, like sea turtles and birds, think microplastic is food. Eating microplastic can harm animals; it can choke them, poison them, and affect their ability to reproduce. People also consume fish that have eaten microplastic, exposing them to harmful chemicals found in some plastic products.Questions:1. How would you describe the Pacific Garbage Patch?2. What are two kinds of sea plants that produce the oxygen in the air we breathe?3. What are two ways to reduce the amount of plastic waste that pollutes oceans?please answer this correctly with explanation please i need it i have pass tomorrow​</h2><br />

                            19. pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</h2><br />

Just like a birthday is a special day to celebrate a person Earth Day is a special daythat celebrates the Earth Earth Day was born on April 22, 1970 in San Francisco, California. Every year,America and over 100 different countries join together in the celebration of Earth Day on April 22nd Earth dayis the largest, most celebrated environmental event worldwide. On Earth Day, we rememeber to appreciatenature and learn ways to protect our environment. Find ways that you can help keep the planet clean andprotect our environment!schThe Earth is humongous, having the diameter of 7. 926 miles. It orbits around the sum of a speed of 18.5miles per second or 67,000 miles per hour. Seventy one percent of the Earth's surface is water: the PacificOcean makes up 70 million squared miles of that coverage. The force of gravity is strong that you would needto travel at a speed at least seven miles per second to escape it. Approximately two million species of animals,plants and other organisms have been identified and named: it is estimated that approximately 50 millionspecies have yet to be identified.If everyone in the United States recycled their newspapers, the lives of 41,000 tress woul be spared. Onesingle tree can detoxify the air of up of to 60 pounds of pollutants. To make an aluminum can from recycledmaterials takes only five percent of the energy normally needed to make acan, an energy savings Of 95%.The energy saved by recycling just one aluminum can is enough to power a television set for three hours.Recycling glass bottles allows the energy consumption for new glass products to be cut in half.Answer the comprehension check.1.

                            25. Directions: Read the passage and answer the questions that follow. Write theletter of the correct answer.         Plastic PollutionDid you know that every year 8 milliontons of plastic end up in our planet's beautifulblue oceans? And that's seriously bad newsfor our friends beneath the waves...Over 700 species of marineanimals have been reported to have eaten orbeen entangled in plastic - and scientiststhink that the amount of plastic in the oceanmay triple by 2050! But here is the good news – by understanding the issue andtaking action, you can help change the future and make our oceans a clean,safe place for our wonderful wildlife!The problem is that most of us use more plastic than we need to, and half ofthe plastic we produce is designed to be used just once and chucked away. Thisso-called 'single-use plastic is used to make all kinds of items, such as shoppingbags, straws, food wrappers and various packaging. And because plastictakes over 400 years to decompose (break down), it stays in the natural world,causing damage, for a very long time.Scientists think that a whopping 8.8 million tons of plastic end up in the oceanevery year. That is the same as stacking five plastic shopping bags of rubbishon top of each other on every meter of coastline in the world! But how does it allget there?One way is through 'ocean dumping, when people illegally tip largeamounts of waste directly into the sea. But not all plastic in the ocean is dumpedthere on purpose. In fact, around 80% plastic in the sea comes from the land...Animals and birds can get trapped, tangled, and even strangled by allkinds of plastic waste, such as discarded fishing nets and six-pack rings from drink cans.they also mistakes small bits of plastic such as bottle tops and wrappers for food and gobble them up leaving no room in their swollen thumb is for real food and the problem does not end there by working together our choices can help clean up the ocean and make it a safe place for our amazing marine life Questions:1.what type of informational/factual text is the passage above?a.expositoryb.factual descriptionc.factual recountd.persuasive2.what is the purpose of this type of text?a.to persuadeb.to entairtainc.to described.to narrate3.what kind of verb is the word"can" in the last paragraph?a.sensingb.linkingc.nounsd.action4.what part of speech are the parenthesis?"(whopping)8.8million,(shopping) bags,(amazing) marine life".a.adjectivesb.connectivesc.nounsd.verbs5.what part of speech are the following---pollution,news,ocean,scientists?a.adjectivesb.connectivesc.nounsd.verbsplsss answer my question i mark you as a brainliest and i give you 25 points​</h2><br />
