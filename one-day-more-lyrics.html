                                            Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

The best trip my family ever took was to New Orleans, Louisiana. We drove there in two days. I didn'tthink it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We saw the Mississippi River, rode a horse carriage inthe French Quarter, and visited a cemetery where everyone was buried above the ground. I liked the foodbest, especially the New Orleans doughnuts called beignets.2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensilsbefore using them. Clean utensils won't transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eatwith.3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don't realize that every time theyhear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, manysong lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn't old-fashioned; it's asmodern as the latest hit song.4. Growing a garden can be fun, good exercise, and will provide fresh fruits and vegetables for thegardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It issometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Plantingthe seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow andproduce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about whathappened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening thenext day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or justcounting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music ogentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mindenough that you will be asleep in no time. ​</a>

When mice are kept at high population densities, their behavior changes in anumber of ways. Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases.Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communalnesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, most unusualcommunal living. None survived because most of the mothers deserted them immediatelyafter birth.4. There are three different types of rock music, alternative rock, classic rock, andhard rock, also known as metal. Alternative rock features a steady bass drum laying downthe beat, with easy flowing guitar riffs over the top. The bass line is toned town, and thelyrics are sung with intensity an authority. Depending on the song, the guitars can either beacoustic guitars or electric guitars. Classic rock combines a steady driving bass drum sound,with high snare overtones, steady and often repeating guitar riffs, and an intensive bass line.The guitars are more often than not all electric guitars, and distortion is rarely used. Thelyrics are sung with style and enthusiasm. Hard rock, or metal, features a hard rolling bassdrum with an abundant amount of cymbal work. This style of rock uses several electricguitars with heavy distortion to bring a very intense sound. A hard, intense, driving bass linerounds out the style. The lyrics aren't really sung so much as screamed. It doesn't matterwhat your preference is, each different style of rock music is unique on its own.5. The moon is our closest neighbor. It's 250,000 miles away. It's gravity is only 1/6that of Earth. This means a boy weighing 120 pounds in Virginia would weigh only 20pounds on the moon. In addition, there is no atmosphere on the moon. The footprints left byastronauts back in 1969 are still there, as crisply formed as they were on the day they weremade. The lack of atmosphere also means there is no water in the moon, an importantproblem when travelling there.with the closest meaning,  ​</a>

BOHOLANO LYRIC POEM
From Region VII
And in the midst of these gem-like Islands,
Is one more blessed with singular beauty,
Gowned in the green of emeralds,
Skirted by beaches of alabaster sands,
And crowned in splendor by deep-blue 
heights.
Others call her Paradise,
But the natives of the place call her,
Bohol . . .
This is Bohol . . .
Land of the endless charms, mystery and 
the 
Perpetual sun; land of the cone-shaped
Chocolate Hills, of verdant plains, crystal
Watercourses, underground pools,
Virgin forest, and powdery
White sands.
This is Bohol

Magellan landed in Limasawa at noon
The people met him very welcome on the 
shore
They did not understand the speaking 
they have done
Because Kastila gid at Waray-Waray 
man
When Magellan landed in Cebu City
Rajah Humabon met him, they were very 
happy
All people were baptized and built the 
church of Christ
And that’s the beginning of our Catholic 
life
When Magellan visited in Mactan
To christianize them everyone
But Lapu-Lapu met him on the shore
and drive Magellan to go back home
Then Magellan got so mad
Ordered his men to camouflage
“Mactan island we could not grab
‘Cause Lapu Lapu is very hard”
Then the battle began at dawn
Bolos and spears versus guns and
cannons
When Magellan was hit on his neck
He stumble down and cried and cried

                                            The paragraphs below consist of shuffled parts of a movie review. Arrange the paragraphs to form a comprehensive movie review of the film, “Kita-Kita”. Organize the paragraphs using the letters of the alphabet. Start with the letter A to arrange the paragraphs in sequential order. ____________1. It’s so simple an idea but it works. “Kita Kita” is really just a two-actor film about a Filipino tour guide in Saporro, Japan, who gets her heart broken and goes blind. Her neighbor, also a Filipino, comes over to her house every day to try and cheer her up and a romance blossoms between them. The movie revolves around this simple plot yet it fills out its 84-minute running time and leaves you completely satisfied at the end. There’s this push and pull about the gimmick of her being blind but it’s used more narratively, and even lyrically, than it is for easy jokes. ____________2. ‘Kita Kita’ is an eye-opener for the romantic comedy genre ____________3. And writer/director Sigrid Andrea Bernardo knows what to do with her camera. In a film about not being able to see, she knows when to give us close-ups and knows when to zoom out. She frames the couple amidst a backdrop of a quaint and rural Japan with the knowledge that one of these characters cannot see it. But in the breaking down of Lea’s walls, the grand architecture or the fields of multi-colored flowers become symbols of Lea’s internal world. It’s a lovely use of cinematography for a film like this. ____________4. It seems, in its trailers, that the comedy is going to stem from Empoy Marquez being not the typical matinee idol and romantic lead type for a woman as gorgeous as Alessandra de Rossi except, since she’s blind, she doesn’t know that. But the film never goes there. It doesn’t go for the easy laughs. Her blindness is caused by the stress of her breakup, and she is shut out from life, and Marquez’s Tonyo asks her to be his tour guide as he will be her eyes. What unfolds is a story about kindness and how it can warm even the coldest of hearts. The film utiliz</a>

                                            Direction: In each paragraph below, write the topic sentence in your answer sheet.
1. The best trip my family ever took was to Tagaytay. We drove there in 4 hours. I didn’t think it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We stayed in Tagaytay Highlands. We rode the cable car, and visited a mini zoo where there was a parrot who stole mom’s earring! I liked the climate best, because it was cool unlike the usual warm climate we have in Pampanga. 
2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensils before using them. Clean utensils won’t transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eat with. 
3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don’t realize that every time they hear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, many song lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn’t old-fashioned; it’s as modern as the latest hit song!
4. Growing a garden can be fun, can allow a person to have good exercise, and can provide fresh fruits and vegetables for the gardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It is sometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Planting the seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow and produce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.
5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about what happened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening the next day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or just counting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music or gentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mind enough that you will be able to sleep in no time.</a>

Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases.Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communalnesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, most unusualcommunal living. None survived because most of the mothers deserted them immediatelyafter birth.4. There are three different types of rock music, alternative rock, classic rock, andhard rock, also known as metal. Alternative rock features a steady bass drum laying downthe beat, with easy flowing guitar riffs over the top. The bass line is toned town, and thelyrics are sung with intensity an authority. Depending on the song, the guitars can either beacoustic guitars or electric guitars. Classic rock combines a steady driving bass drum sound,with high snare overtones, steady and often repeating guitar riffs, and an intensive bass line.The guitars are more often than not all electric guitars, and distortion is rarely used. Thelyrics are sung with style and enthusiasm. Hard rock, or metal, features a hard rolling bassdrum with an abundant amount of cymbal work. This style of rock uses several electricguitars with heavy distortion to bring a very intense sound. A hard, intense, driving bass linerounds out the style. The lyrics aren't really sung so much as screamed. It doesn't matterwhat your preference is, each different style of rock music is unique on its own.5. The moon is our closest neighbor. It's 250,000 miles away. It's gravity is only 1/6that of Earth. This means a boy weighing 120 pounds in Virginia would weigh only 20pounds on the moon. In addition, there is no atmosphere on the moon. The footprints left byastronauts back in 1969 are still there, as crisply formed as they were on the day they weremade. The lack of atmosphere also means there is no water in the moon, an importantproblem when travelling there.with the closest meaning,  ​</h2><br />

BOHOLANO LYRIC POEM
From Region VII
And in the midst of these gem-like Islands,
Is one more blessed with singular beauty,
Gowned in the green of emeralds,
Skirted by beaches of alabaster sands,
And crowned in splendor by deep-blue 
heights.
Others call her Paradise,
But the natives of the place call her,
Bohol . . .
This is Bohol . . .
Land of the endless charms, mystery and 
the 
Perpetual sun; land of the cone-shaped
Chocolate Hills, of verdant plains, crystal
Watercourses, underground pools,
Virgin forest, and powdery
White sands.
This is Bohol

Magellan
By Yoyoy Villame
On March 16, 1521
When Philippines was discovered by 
Magellan
They were sailing day and night across 
the big ocean
Until they saw a small Limasawa island
Magellan landed in Limasawa at noon
The people met him very welcome on the 
shore
They did not understand the speaking 
they have done
Because Kastila gid at Waray-Waray 
man
When Magellan landed in Cebu City
Rajah Humabon met him, they were very 
happy
All people were baptized and built the 
church of Christ
And that’s the beginning of our Catholic 
life
When Magellan visited in Mactan
To christianize them everyone
But Lapu-Lapu met him on the shore
and drive Magellan to go back home
Then Magellan got so mad
Ordered his men to camouflage
“Mactan island we could not grab
‘Cause Lapu Lapu is very hard”
Then the battle began at dawn
Bolos and spears versus guns and
cannons
When Magellan was hit on his neck
He stumble down and cried and cried

                            9. The paragraphs below consist of shuffled parts of a movie review. Arrange the paragraphs to form a comprehensive movie review of the film, “Kita-Kita”. Organize the paragraphs using the letters of the alphabet. Start with the letter A to arrange the paragraphs in sequential order. ____________1. It’s so simple an idea but it works. “Kita Kita” is really just a two-actor film about a Filipino tour guide in Saporro, Japan, who gets her heart broken and goes blind. Her neighbor, also a Filipino, comes over to her house every day to try and cheer her up and a romance blossoms between them. The movie revolves around this simple plot yet it fills out its 84-minute running time and leaves you completely satisfied at the end. There’s this push and pull about the gimmick of her being blind but it’s used more narratively, and even lyrically, than it is for easy jokes. ____________2. ‘Kita Kita’ is an eye-opener for the romantic comedy genre ____________3. And writer/director Sigrid Andrea Bernardo knows what to do with her camera. In a film about not being able to see, she knows when to give us close-ups and knows when to zoom out. She frames the couple amidst a backdrop of a quaint and rural Japan with the knowledge that one of these characters cannot see it. But in the breaking down of Lea’s walls, the grand architecture or the fields of multi-colored flowers become symbols of Lea’s internal world. It’s a lovely use of cinematography for a film like this. ____________4. It seems, in its trailers, that the comedy is going to stem from Empoy Marquez being not the typical matinee idol and romantic lead type for a woman as gorgeous as Alessandra de Rossi except, since she’s blind, she doesn’t know that. But the film never goes there. It doesn’t go for the easy laughs. Her blindness is caused by the stress of her breakup, and she is shut out from life, and Marquez’s Tonyo asks her to be his tour guide as he will be her eyes. What unfolds is a story about kindness and how it can warm even the coldest of hearts. The film utiliz</h2><br />

                            11. Direction: In each paragraph below, write the topic sentence in your answer sheet.
1. The best trip my family ever took was to Tagaytay. We drove there in 4 hours. I didn’t think it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We stayed in Tagaytay Highlands. We rode the cable car, and visited a mini zoo where there was a parrot who stole mom’s earring! I liked the climate best, because it was cool unlike the usual warm climate we have in Pampanga. 
2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensils before using them. Clean utensils won’t transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eat with. 
3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don’t realize that every time they hear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, many song lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn’t old-fashioned; it’s as modern as the latest hit song!
4. Growing a garden can be fun, can allow a person to have good exercise, and can provide fresh fruits and vegetables for the gardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It is sometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Planting the seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow and produce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.
5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about what happened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening the next day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or just counting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music or gentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mind enough that you will be able to sleep in no time.</h2><br />
