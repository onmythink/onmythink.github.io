                    <p>(From the Tinguian Story)Monina A. MercadoAponi-tolau, lord of the mountains, was bored with the view from the peak. When he looked up on a clear day, there was nothingbut brilliant blue skies. On days when rain threatened, there was nothing but dark billowing clouds. When days were just right - neithertoo sunny nor too cloudy - bunches of white clouds or wisps here and there touched the sky. It was so boring.When Aponi-tolau looked down, the plains were rolling green as if it was the time of rains and brilliant ocher; as if it was thesummer. As far as his eyes could see, there was just the Earth, crossed here and there with a silver river or two. The view never changed,whether he looked up or down from the mountain top.From the time Aponi-tolau was a little boy, he had to live at the highest peak, for he was the lord of the mountains. His motherwas Langaan, goddess of the wind and the rain. She was delighted that her son lived at the peak, for there she could send the NorthWind to caress him awake, the South Wind ti sing him to sleep, the showers of May to cool his brow, and the monsoon rains of July todeepen the forests that sheltered him.Now a young man, Aponi-tolau was restless. He wanted to see new places and meet new people, walk on the flat earth of theplains, run and feel the earth and the grass beneath his feet. There was no place to walk at the mountain peak and nowhere to run. If hewalked farther than the front yard of his home, the earth dropped down the mountain slope. If he was adventurous and walked beyondthe backyard, there was a sheer drop of rock down the stone face of the mountain. It was so boring.One day, Aponi-tolau ran away from the mountain peak. He hurried down the slope, running down than walking. Down, downthe slope he plunged. His eagerness gave him wings. Soon, he was on the plains. He walked on, close at last to the fields that lookedlike green tapestry from on high, to the trees that looked like puffy green blossoms from afar, and to people who looked like moving dollsfrom the peak. One day, he followed the course of a river. He wanted to see where it went from its silent pools beneath lush tress, fromits cascades, and from its rills among great shiny rocks. The river brought him to the sea. Never before had been so close to the sea.How wondrous it was! As he stood on the sand, waves from the distant blue rushed in, rising high and racing each other to the shore.But, when they came near to Aponi-tolau, the waves broke and bowed, slipped gently in and touched his feet with small, shy and delicatekisses.Aponi-tolau was bewitched. He must go into the sea and sail into the deep. He must follow it to the very end of its blue distance?.what is tha exposition​</p>

The Story of Maria Sinukuan
Once upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit
trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed
this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit
trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and the animals was no
other than Mariang Sinukuan. These fruit trees and animals, Mariang Sinukuan
used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to
see at their doorsteps fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was
Mariang Sinukuan who left this foods while they were sleeping. How grateful the
people were to be graced by the enchanted lady. And to show their gratitude and
respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people
considered her home as a sacred place.
But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no
longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted
to get more.
One day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat. They wanted to
get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They started for the
mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise.
Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate
branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big fruits they
bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one’s reach. Fowls of every kind were
plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were
still viewing this wonder of nature when from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan.
They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not find any words to say to her.
It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them.
” Welcome to my home, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as
you can but I’m warning you not to take anything home without my knowledge.”
With this, the enchanted lady departed.
After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits.
They ate and ate until they could not eat any more.
“Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which I brought,” said one.
“No, let’s not do that. Let’s go home now,” said another. “I’m scared.”
” Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?”
” But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge.”
“Oh, come on. She won’t know we took home fruits and animals. They’re so
plentiful, she won’t know the difference.”
And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and
animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were
about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn’t
mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load
was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men
were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They
remembered Mariang Sinukuan’s warning. The young men became terribly
frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry
them. But before they reached the base of the mountain whom did they see
blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry.
“You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me.
You are not satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even
try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I’m going to turn you all into a
swine.” With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men
into swine.
This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang
Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Again and again they tried to steal them. At last,
fed up with the people’s greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at
their doorsteps. She caused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to
disappear. She no longer showed herself to the people for she was disgusted
with their greediness.</a>

                                            The Legend of Maria Makiling (Excerpt)Once upon a time, a diwata lived in a mountain of Laguna. She was called Maria Makiling. She was very beautiful. Maria was always about helping other people. One time, the children of a farmer got sick. When he went to Maria to seek help, he was given a bilao full of ginger.The farmer sadly went home carrying the bilao of ginger. When he reached his hut, he was greatly surprised: the ginger had turned to gold! Because of Maria's kindness, the townsfolk had grown to love her.Maria was a great beauty. She had many suitors who were rich and powerful such as Captain Lara and the rich adventurer Joselito and many others. Secretly, Maria Makiling favored a poor farmer named Juan among all her suitors because of his simplicity and humility. As time passed, her suitors became more and more impatient and demanded that Maria tell them who she loves so the diwata was forced to promise: "By the night of the full moon. I will tell you my answer."When the night of the full moon arrived, all of her suitors climbed up the mountain to know her decision. They were all disappointed when Maria told them that it was Juan whom she loved. The suitors went away very angry with Juan. Captain Lara and Joselito thought of a plan against him. One day, all was surprised when a huge fire burned a wooden building guarded by Captain Lara. With the help of Joselito, they blamed the fire to Juan who was tortured in the prison. On his dying moments, Juan was still calling the name of Maria Makiling. It was heard by the diwata so she quickly went down her mountain. But Juan was already dead whenMaria arrived and all Maria could do was to cry endlessly beside Juan's dead body. The next day. Maria Makilingwas gone and was never seen again by the people.character:setings:plot:theme:point of view:​</a>

I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, "They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, "ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's "You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "llaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles. At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goats, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta via rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.I need Po It now thanks ​</a>

                                            Read the story before answering:
Once upon a time in this beautiful lake surrounded by mountains and the sweetest mango trees lived a monkey.
The lake also had a few crocodiles. There was one crocodile who was very fond of the mangoes that fell from the tree.
 As the crocodile visited the mango trees every day, it became friends with the monkey. The two animals would meet
every day. The monkey helped the crocodile by providing him with the freshest mangoes from the tree. In return, the
crocodile would make the monkey laugh with his silly jokes. Their relationship continued and they became close pals.
One day, the monkey took more mangoes from the tree and asked the crocodile to give some to his wife. The
crocodile readily agreed thinking that this would make his wife happy.
True enough, the crocodile’s wife was pleased. “These are the best-tasting mangoes in the entire lake!” The wife
was so curious about the mangoes and asked her husband where he got the fruits from. The crocodile told her about his
close friend, the monkey.
Suddenly, the crocodile’s wife made an evil plan in her mind. She asked her husband, “Does your friend eat these
fruits daily? These are the sweetest fruits we ever ate. Imagine how delicious the monkey’s heart would be if he ate
these fruits daily! I need the heart of your friend. Can you please bring it for me?”
The crocodile was startled by his wife’s comments. He replied, “But he is my close friend. I can’t do this to him.”
The crocodile’s wife told him, “Don’t worry! You can drown your friend by pretending to push him down into the water if he
doesn’t know how to swim.”
The crocodile thought about it for a long time but he finally agreed to bring the monkey to his wife.
The next day, the crocodile invited the monkey to join him and his wife for lunch. The monkey happily agreed
to be the guest. However, the monkey expressed his inability to swim in the lake.
The crocodile offered to carry the monkey on his back even bringing him back to the mango trees. The monkey
accepted his offer and rode on his back. As they reached halfway to their destination, the crocodile went under the water
to drown the monkey.
However, the monkey did not fall because he held tightly to the crocodile. The monkey got suspicious about
the crocodile’s actions and asked him to tell the truth.
Since the crocodile believed the monkey was his good friend, he confessed to the monkey about the conversation
he had with his wife. He even confessed to his wife’s plans to eat his heart!
The monkey was quick to respond, “Oh my dear friend, you should have told me this earlier. I left my heart on one
of the branches of the mango tree as I won’t carry it if I travel long. If you take me back, I can give you my heart.”
The crocodile agreed and took the monkey back to his mango trees. As they reached the tree where the monkey
lived, the monkey climbed quickly and escaped from the crocodile. He shouted at Crocodile, “I thought you were a good
friend but you cheated on me! I will never go back with you and never be your friend.”
The crocodile understood his mistake and returned home empty-handed, losing a good friend indeed.

                                            Iam a Filipino-inheritor of a glorious past, hostageto the uncertain future. As such I must prove equal to atwo-fold task-the task of meeting my responsibility to thepast, and the task of performing my obligation to thefuture.I am sprung from a hardy race-child manygenerations removed of ancient Malayan pioneers. Acrossthe centuries the memory comes rushing back to me; ofbrown-skinned men, putting out to sea in ships that wereas frail as their hearts were stout. Over the sea I see themcome, born upon the billowing wave and the whistlingwind, carried upon the mighty swell of hope-hope in thefree abundance of the new land that was to be their homeand their children's forever.This is the land they sought and found. Every inchof shore that their eyes first set upon, every hill andmountain that beckoned to them with a green and purpleinvitation, every mile of rolling plain that their viewencompassed, every river and lake that promised a plentifulliving and the fruitfulness of commerce, is a hallowed spottome,Pro. ©@ErollDyosa​</a>

                            1. (From the Tinguian Story)Monina A. MercadoAponi-tolau, lord of the mountains, was bored with the view from the peak. When he looked up on a clear day, there was nothingbut brilliant blue skies. On days when rain threatened, there was nothing but dark billowing clouds. When days were just right - neithertoo sunny nor too cloudy - bunches of white clouds or wisps here and there touched the sky. It was so boring.When Aponi-tolau looked down, the plains were rolling green as if it was the time of rains and brilliant ocher; as if it was thesummer. As far as his eyes could see, there was just the Earth, crossed here and there with a silver river or two. The view never changed,whether he looked up or down from the mountain top.From the time Aponi-tolau was a little boy, he had to live at the highest peak, for he was the lord of the mountains. His motherwas Langaan, goddess of the wind and the rain. She was delighted that her son lived at the peak, for there she could send the NorthWind to caress him awake, the South Wind ti sing him to sleep, the showers of May to cool his brow, and the monsoon rains of July todeepen the forests that sheltered him.Now a young man, Aponi-tolau was restless. He wanted to see new places and meet new people, walk on the flat earth of theplains, run and feel the earth and the grass beneath his feet. There was no place to walk at the mountain peak and nowhere to run. If hewalked farther than the front yard of his home, the earth dropped down the mountain slope. If he was adventurous and walked beyondthe backyard, there was a sheer drop of rock down the stone face of the mountain. It was so boring.One day, Aponi-tolau ran away from the mountain peak. He hurried down the slope, running down than walking. Down, downthe slope he plunged. His eagerness gave him wings. Soon, he was on the plains. He walked on, close at last to the fields that lookedlike green tapestry from on high, to the trees that looked like puffy green blossoms from afar, and to people who looked like moving dollsfrom the peak. One day, he followed the course of a river. He wanted to see where it went from its silent pools beneath lush tress, fromits cascades, and from its rills among great shiny rocks. The river brought him to the sea. Never before had been so close to the sea.How wondrous it was! As he stood on the sand, waves from the distant blue rushed in, rising high and racing each other to the shore.But, when they came near to Aponi-tolau, the waves broke and bowed, slipped gently in and touched his feet with small, shy and delicatekisses.Aponi-tolau was bewitched. He must go into the sea and sail into the deep. He must follow it to the very end of its blue distance?.what is tha exposition​</h2><br />

The Story of Maria Sinukuan
Once upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit
trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed
this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit
trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and the animals was no
other than Mariang Sinukuan. These fruit trees and animals, Mariang Sinukuan
used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to
see at their doorsteps fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was
Mariang Sinukuan who left this foods while they were sleeping. How grateful the
people were to be graced by the enchanted lady. And to show their gratitude and
respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people
considered her home as a sacred place.
But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no
longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted
to get more.
One day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat. They wanted to
get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They started for the
mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise.
Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate
branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big fruits they
bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one’s reach. Fowls of every kind were
plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were
still viewing this wonder of nature when from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan.
They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not find any words to say to her.
It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them.
” Welcome to my home, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as
you can but I’m warning you not to take anything home without my knowledge.”
With this, the enchanted lady departed.
After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits.
They ate and ate until they could not eat any more.
“Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which I brought,” said one.
“No, let’s not do that. Let’s go home now,” said another. “I’m scared.”
” Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?”
” But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge.”
“Oh, come on. She won’t know we took home fruits and animals. They’re so
plentiful, she won’t know the difference.”
And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and
animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were
about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn’t
mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load
was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men
were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They
remembered Mariang Sinukuan’s warning. The young men became terribly
frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry
them. But before they reached the base of the mountain whom did they see
blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry.
“You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me.
You are not satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even
try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I’m going to turn you all into a
swine.” With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men
into swine.
This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang
Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Again and again they tried to steal them. At last,
fed up with the people’s greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at
their doorsteps. She caused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to
disappear. She no longer showed herself to the people for she was disgusted
with their greediness.</h2><br />

                            5. The Legend of Maria Makiling (Excerpt)Once upon a time, a diwata lived in a mountain of Laguna. She was called Maria Makiling. She was very beautiful. Maria was always about helping other people. One time, the children of a farmer got sick. When he went to Maria to seek help, he was given a bilao full of ginger.The farmer sadly went home carrying the bilao of ginger. When he reached his hut, he was greatly surprised: the ginger had turned to gold! Because of Maria's kindness, the townsfolk had grown to love her.Maria was a great beauty. She had many suitors who were rich and powerful such as Captain Lara and the rich adventurer Joselito and many others. Secretly, Maria Makiling favored a poor farmer named Juan among all her suitors because of his simplicity and humility. As time passed, her suitors became more and more impatient and demanded that Maria tell them who she loves so the diwata was forced to promise: "By the night of the full moon. I will tell you my answer."When the night of the full moon arrived, all of her suitors climbed up the mountain to know her decision. They were all disappointed when Maria told them that it was Juan whom she loved. The suitors went away very angry with Juan. Captain Lara and Joselito thought of a plan against him. One day, all was surprised when a huge fire burned a wooden building guarded by Captain Lara. With the help of Joselito, they blamed the fire to Juan who was tortured in the prison. On his dying moments, Juan was still calling the name of Maria Makiling. It was heard by the diwata so she quickly went down her mountain. But Juan was already dead whenMaria arrived and all Maria could do was to cry endlessly beside Juan's dead body. The next day. Maria Makilingwas gone and was never seen again by the people.character:setings:plot:theme:point of view:​</h2><br />

I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, "They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, "ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's "You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "llaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles. At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goats, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta via rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.I need Po It now thanks ​</h2><br />

                            7. Read the story before answering:
Once upon a time in this beautiful lake surrounded by mountains and the sweetest mango trees lived a monkey.
The lake also had a few crocodiles. There was one crocodile who was very fond of the mangoes that fell from the tree.
 As the crocodile visited the mango trees every day, it became friends with the monkey. The two animals would meet
every day. The monkey helped the crocodile by providing him with the freshest mangoes from the tree. In return, the
crocodile would make the monkey laugh with his silly jokes. Their relationship continued and they became close pals.
One day, the monkey took more mangoes from the tree and asked the crocodile to give some to his wife. The
crocodile readily agreed thinking that this would make his wife happy.
True enough, the crocodile’s wife was pleased. “These are the best-tasting mangoes in the entire lake!” The wife
was so curious about the mangoes and asked her husband where he got the fruits from. The crocodile told her about his
close friend, the monkey.
Suddenly, the crocodile’s wife made an evil plan in her mind. She asked her husband, “Does your friend eat these
fruits daily? These are the sweetest fruits we ever ate. Imagine how delicious the monkey’s heart would be if he ate
these fruits daily! I need the heart of your friend. Can you please bring it for me?”
The crocodile was startled by his wife’s comments. He replied, “But he is my close friend. I can’t do this to him.”
The crocodile’s wife told him, “Don’t worry! You can drown your friend by pretending to push him down into the water if he
doesn’t know how to swim.”
The crocodile thought about it for a long time but he finally agreed to bring the monkey to his wife.
The next day, the crocodile invited the monkey to join him and his wife for lunch. The monkey happily agreed
to be the guest. However, the monkey expressed his inability to swim in the lake.
The crocodile offered to carry the monkey on his back even bringing him back to the mango trees. The monkey
accepted his offer and rode on his back. As they reached halfway to their destination, the crocodile went under the water
to drown the monkey.
However, the monkey did not fall because he held tightly to the crocodile. The monkey got suspicious about
the crocodile’s actions and asked him to tell the truth.
Since the crocodile believed the monkey was his good friend, he confessed to the monkey about the conversation
he had with his wife. He even confessed to his wife’s plans to eat his heart!
The monkey was quick to respond, “Oh my dear friend, you should have told me this earlier. I left my heart on one
of the branches of the mango tree as I won’t carry it if I travel long. If you take me back, I can give you my heart.”
The crocodile agreed and took the monkey back to his mango trees. As they reached the tree where the monkey
lived, the monkey climbed quickly and escaped from the crocodile. He shouted at Crocodile, “I thought you were a good
friend but you cheated on me! I will never go back with you and never be your friend.”
The crocodile understood his mistake and returned home empty-handed, losing a good friend indeed.
