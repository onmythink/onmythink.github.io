A public school is government funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language) or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

 The Philippines’ Pandemic Response: A Tragedy of Errors
The Philippine government has been boasting that as early as March 16, they had the gumption to implement a lockdown in major cities and provinces in response to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. However, Manila’s overall response to the pandemic has been fraught with incompetence and rife with terror. 
The implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) came on the heels of serious negligence — namely, the authorities failing to keep up with the preventive measures of neighboring countries and grossly underestimating the virus. What’s worse, instead of easing the overall burden that the virus unleashed on the country, it seems the last resort lockdown itself added to a plethora of problems without adequately addressing the primary crisis at hand: ensuring public health and safety.
Strict compliance with the ECQ is ordered for all citizens, with the exception of frontline professionals, until at least May 15. That has meant curfews, harsh penalties for being outside, and an impoverished population descending into hunger. 
The global crisis is first and foremost a public health issue, but Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has faced the coronavirus pandemic in a decidedly militaristic fashion. Since the lockdown went into effect, he has peddled the narrative of pasaways or “undisciplined” citizens as responsible for the ensuing problems. He has also brought up unsubstantiated activities of guerrilla groups as threats to government aid efforts without conceding any missteps in his management. On top of deploying thousands of police and soldiers throughout the archipelago to enforce the ECQ, Duterte has on two occasions threatened the public with all-out martial law. There have been moments of abject incompetence from those in power around the world, but using the pandemic as a reason for increasingly flexing authoritarian muscles spells danger for the Philippines post-lockdown.</a>

The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.Questions: 1. If you were in the same situation, what would you do? 2.

It is necessary to be prepared for the coming of any typhoon as predicted. First and foremost, inspect your house if it needs to be repaired or fixed. Then, clean up the house drainage system to avoid blockage. Next, store an adequate supply of food and water good for a few days. Ensure that appliances should be placed in an elevated position. They might be damaged if water penetrates into them in case floodwater rushes into your house. Lastly, always keep flashlights, candles, batteries, and first aid supplies 4. The moon and sun are both bright round objects in the sky. Indeed, viewed from the earth's surface, both appear as similarly sized disks. That said, however, they are otherwise very different. The sun is a star, while the moon is a large mass of work rock and dirt. According to most theories, the sun formed from the solar nebula, a giant mass of cloud and dust that collapsed because of its gravity. When it did, the material that pulled into the center formed the sun when the Earth was formed in the early solar system, it didn't have moon. The moon was likely created when a large planet collided with the Earth. The resulting particle cloud rose and eventually condensed. 5. Getting ready for snowy day.

What evidence is there to convince the reader that this is an opinion. Choose three statements from the passage, Jeepney- A Product of Filipino Ingenuity, and complete the Assertion Sheet below.Jeepney – A Product of Filipino Ingenuity (Excerpt)Carmen Guerrero-NakpilIf one were looking for a symbol of post-war Philippines, one could do no better than the jeepney, which is as abundant and as persistent as post-war mosquitoes, and as much a creature of improvisation1 as the post-war Filipino. The jeepney, unique in the world, is a tiny bus built by superimposing a shop-made body on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its drivers, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric2decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way behind the original chassis and when fully loaded, its rear lists dangerously close to the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying twelve people – as it often does when business is good. A jeepney is hardly without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield, the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an imaginative estimate of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not or a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion. They are allusive3, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, the name of showgirls and actresses or slogans. They undoubtedly add piquancy4to the trafficproblem. The jeepney‘s cramped interior has undergone an even more complete transformation. Above the cracked and dusty windshield, there is usually a strip of mirror, ornamented in the Venetian style, which enables its driver-conductor to keep an eye on passengers who have not paid their fares. A central place on it is reserved for an icon or print of ―Our Lady of Perpetual Help‖ or ―St. Anthony,‖ with a bunch of dusty paper flowers or a garland of sampaguitas paying tribute to the operator‘s favorite devotion. Anyone who has taken a ride in a jeepney will realize how necessary it is to explore the intercession of the saints. The jeepney‘sikon is as traditional as the chapel where bullfighters kneel before courting death. Having made his box to the Divinity, the jeepney driver proceeds to be as bravo as a matador.1) Assertion (statement that starts argument)2) Reasoning (statement that supports assertion and explains why audience should believe it)3) Evidence (statement that back up reasoning)4) My Reaction (your own opinion on the author’s assertion)​</a>

                                            1. Junk Food is very harmful that is slowly eating away the health of the present generation. The term itself denotes how dangerous it is for our bodies. Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

By that time, ash from the eruption reached Manila, forcing the airport to close and more than 500 flights to be canceled and the danger level was raised to level four, which indicates "a hazardous eruption within hours to days was possible." On Monday, hundreds of thousands of people faced possible evacuations in the area around the Filipino capital as the country's Taal volcano (which is just south of Manila) started to erupt, The Associated Press reported. And experts say this could just be the beginning, adding it's possible people will see yet another "hazardous explosive eruption." So far, more than 30,000 villagers have evacuated, but there have been no reports of casualties or major damage. The airport has been partially reopened. According to The AP, citing the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, the start of activity in the Taal volcano on Sunday was sudden, initially spurting steam, ash and pebbles up to nine miles into the air. This eruption comes just weeks after a volcano erupted on New Zealand's White Island, which killed at least 18 people, many of them tourists.1.

                                            n Metro Manila, city planners are also called urban planners. They determine the best use of a community’s land and resources for homes, business,
and recreation. They also work on community problems such as traffic congestion and air pollution. The effects of the proposed changes in the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) to general community quarantine (GCQ) in the metro are also being studied by them. These Planners use mathematical analysis to evaluate the different conditions and to predict the impact of each condition on a community.
Planners wanted to construct and justify statements about the proportionality between the cause and effect of their
planning and its implementation to the community. They use different signs that using equilateral triangles which are similar to inform the public on the direction and danger.
These strategies are comparable to the Triangle Similarity Theorems such
as AA (angle-angle) Similarity Postulate, SAS (side-angle-side) Similarity
Theorem, and SSS (side-side-side) Similarity Theorem. Using these conditions,
the city planner can easily determine the impact of their plan to the community by
comparing it to the scenario on the field.
Your task is to write a reflective learning about the city planners narrated above by answering the questions below. You may express your answers in more critical and creative presentation.
What is the expertise of the city planners based on the story?
Briefly explain the mathematical analysis that these planners use.
How is the idea of similarity of triangles utilized by the city planners as stated in the story?

Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house.

A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants and endowments. A public school is government funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language) or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

 The Philippines’ Pandemic Response: A Tragedy of Errors
The Philippine government has been boasting that as early as March 16, they had the gumption to implement a lockdown in major cities and provinces in response to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. However, Manila’s overall response to the pandemic has been fraught with incompetence and rife with terror. 
The implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) came on the heels of serious negligence — namely, the authorities failing to keep up with the preventive measures of neighboring countries and grossly underestimating the virus. What’s worse, instead of easing the overall burden that the virus unleashed on the country, it seems the last resort lockdown itself added to a plethora of problems without adequately addressing the primary crisis at hand: ensuring public health and safety.
Strict compliance with the ECQ is ordered for all citizens, with the exception of frontline professionals, until at least May 15. That has meant curfews, harsh penalties for being outside, and an impoverished population descending into hunger. 
The global crisis is first and foremost a public health issue, but Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has faced the coronavirus pandemic in a decidedly militaristic fashion. Since the lockdown went into effect, he has peddled the narrative of pasaways or “undisciplined” citizens as responsible for the ensuing problems. He has also brought up unsubstantiated activities of guerrilla groups as threats to government aid efforts without conceding any missteps in his management. On top of deploying thousands of police and soldiers throughout the archipelago to enforce the ECQ, Duterte has on two occasions threatened the public with all-out martial law. There have been moments of abject incompetence from those in power around the world, but using the pandemic as a reason for increasingly flexing authoritarian muscles spells danger for the Philippines post-lockdown.</h2><br />

                            12. Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.Questions: 1. If you were in the same situation, what would you do? 2. How would you solve the conflict?thank you &lt;33​</h2><br />

Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one health 2. Dr. Jose Protacio Rizal was born in the town of Calamba, Laguna on 19h of June 1861. The second son and the seventh among the eleven children of Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso. He began his early education at home with his mother as his first teacher and continued in Binan, Laguna. He entered a Jesuit-run Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a bachelor's degree with highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at the University of Santo Tomas but had to stop because he felt that the Filipino students were being discriminated by their Dominican tutors. He went to Madrid at Universidad Central de Madrid and in 1885 at the age of 24, he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters with a grade of "Excellent". 3. Whole-year round typhoon occurs. It is necessary to be prepared for the coming of any typhoon as predicted. First and foremost, inspect your house if it needs to be repaired or fixed. Then, clean up the house drainage system to avoid blockage. Next, store an adequate supply of food and water good for a few days. Ensure that appliances should be placed in an elevated position. They might be damaged if water penetrates into them in case floodwater rushes into your house. Lastly, always keep flashlights, candles, batteries, and first aid supplies 4. The moon and sun are both bright round objects in the sky. Indeed, viewed from the earth's surface, both appear as similarly sized disks. That said, however, they are otherwise very different. The sun is a star, while the moon is a large mass of work rock and dirt. According to most theories, the sun formed from the solar nebula, a giant mass of cloud and dust that collapsed because of its gravity. When it did, the material that pulled into the center formed the sun when the Earth was formed in the early solar system, it didn't have moon. The moon was likely created when a large planet collided with the Earth. The resulting particle cloud rose and eventually condensed. 5. Getting ready for snowy day. First, put your jacket on your back. Put your left arm in your left sleeve and do the same with the right arm. Next, put your scarf on the back of your neck. Tie a knot Make sure the scarf covers your mouth. Then, put your hat on your head. Make sure the half covers your ears but not your eyes. Finally, put on your mittens​</h2><br />

                            14. Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked. 1. If you were in the same situation, what would you do?2.

For an assertion to be reasonable, it must be supported by accurate citations which refer to evidence from reliable sources such as encyclopedias, academic journals, websites etc. From the author’s assertions about the jeepney, what details does she provide to convince the reader that the information is factual? What evidence is there to convince the reader that this is an opinion. Choose three statements from the passage, Jeepney- A Product of Filipino Ingenuity, and complete the Assertion Sheet below.Jeepney – A Product of Filipino Ingenuity (Excerpt)Carmen Guerrero-NakpilIf one were looking for a symbol of post-war Philippines, one could do no better than the jeepney, which is as abundant and as persistent as post-war mosquitoes, and as much a creature of improvisation1 as the post-war Filipino. The jeepney, unique in the world, is a tiny bus built by superimposing a shop-made body on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its drivers, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric2decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way behind the original chassis and when fully loaded, its rear lists dangerously close to the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying twelve people – as it often does when business is good. A jeepney is hardly without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield, the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an imaginative estimate of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not or a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion. They are allusive3, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, the name of showgirls and actresses or slogans. They undoubtedly add piquancy4to the trafficproblem. The jeepney‘s cramped interior has undergone an even more complete transformation. Above the cracked and dusty windshield, there is usually a strip of mirror, ornamented in the Venetian style, which enables its driver-conductor to keep an eye on passengers who have not paid their fares. A central place on it is reserved for an icon or print of ―Our Lady of Perpetual Help‖ or ―St. Anthony,‖ with a bunch of dusty paper flowers or a garland of sampaguitas paying tribute to the operator‘s favorite devotion. Anyone who has taken a ride in a jeepney will realize how necessary it is to explore the intercession of the saints. The jeepney‘sikon is as traditional as the chapel where bullfighters kneel before courting death. Having made his box to the Divinity, the jeepney driver proceeds to be as bravo as a matador.1) Assertion (statement that starts argument)2) Reasoning (statement that supports assertion and explains why audience should believe it)3) Evidence (statement that back up reasoning)4) My Reaction (your own opinion on the author’s assertion)​</h2><br />

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

3. Mango float is a Filipino icebox cake dessert made with layers of graham crackers, whipped cream, condensed milk, and ripe mangoes. It is a modern variant of the traditional Filipino crema de fruta cake. Here are the steps to follow to prepare it. Prepare a rectangular glass dish with or without a lid. In a bowl, whisk Nestle cream until smooth. Add the condensed and evaporated milk. Whisk until well combined. Using a ladle, place a small amount of the milk mixture into the bottom of the dish, then place a layer of Graham crackers and top with the sliced mangoes. Ladle a mixture again, slowly pours over the crackers and the mangoes, making sure it covers all of the Graham crackers. Repeat by placing layers of crackers, mangoes, and milk mixture. Top off with Graham crumbs (or just crushed some Graham crackers). Cover and freeze overnight. Serve and enjoy!

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

By that time, ash from the eruption reached Manila, forcing the airport to close and more than 500 flights to be canceled and the danger level was raised to level four, which indicates "a hazardous eruption within hours to days was possible." On Monday, hundreds of thousands of people faced possible evacuations in the area around the Filipino capital as the country's Taal volcano (which is just south of Manila) started to erupt, The Associated Press reported. And experts say this could just be the beginning, adding it's possible people will see yet another "hazardous explosive eruption." So far, more than 30,000 villagers have evacuated, but there have been no reports of casualties or major damage. The airport has been partially reopened. According to The AP, citing the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, the start of activity in the Taal volcano on Sunday was sudden, initially spurting steam, ash and pebbles up to nine miles into the air. This eruption comes just weeks after a volcano erupted on New Zealand's White Island, which killed at least 18 people, many of them tourists.1.

                            20. n Metro Manila, city planners are also called urban planners. They determine the best use of a community’s land and resources for homes, business,
and recreation. They also work on community problems such as traffic congestion and air pollution. The effects of the proposed changes in the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) to general community quarantine (GCQ) in the metro are also being studied by them. These Planners use mathematical analysis to evaluate the different conditions and to predict the impact of each condition on a community.
Planners wanted to construct and justify statements about the proportionality between the cause and effect of their
planning and its implementation to the community. They use different signs that using equilateral triangles which are similar to inform the public on the direction and danger.
These strategies are comparable to the Triangle Similarity Theorems such
as AA (angle-angle) Similarity Postulate, SAS (side-angle-side) Similarity
Theorem, and SSS (side-side-side) Similarity Theorem. Using these conditions,
the city planner can easily determine the impact of their plan to the community by
comparing it to the scenario on the field.
Your task is to write a reflective learning about the city planners narrated above by answering the questions below. You may express your answers in more critical and creative presentation.
What is the expertise of the city planners based on the story?
Briefly explain the mathematical analysis that these planners use.
How is the idea of similarity of triangles utilized by the city planners as stated in the story?

It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset.

                        1. Carmen Guerrero Nakpil is the author of the text "The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity."<br /><br />2. The author described the jeepney as a flamboyant, abundantly decorated vehicle that is noisy, crowded, and dangerous. It can carry six to ten passengers, and sometimes up to twelve, and is a creature of improvisation and ingenuity.<br /><br />3. The jeepney symbolizes postwar Philippines, with its abundance, persistence, usefulness, and improvisation. It is a product of Filipino ingenuity and resourcefulness, and a reflection of the country's history and culture.<br /><br />4. The text does not provide a direct answer to this question, but it does highlight the jeepney's usefulness, creativity, and cultural significance.<br /><br />5. As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases. However, the proposed phase-out of jeepneys is a controversial issue that has sparked debates and protests in the Philippines. Supporters argue that it is necessary to modernize the public transportation system and reduce air pollution, while critics argue that it will displace thousands of drivers and harm small businesses.<br />
