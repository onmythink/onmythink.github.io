                                            The Chef and the Performer It is premise that since food requires careful preparation and special skills, it should not just be brought to the table on a platter. Instead, it should be the subject of a performance. Thus, the table becomes the stage; the chef, the performer; and the diners, the audience. The performance starts when the chef puts on his red hat and begins to act his part, he cuts the vegetables with spritely movements, tosses in some seasoning, and then attends to the meat, the fish, or the seafood on hand. The vegetables dance on the grills at the chef's command and jump into the diner's plate. Applause or an encore maybe inevitable, but of course, the test of the pudding is in eating. Comprehension Questions A. What is the main idea of the paragraph? B. Explain the analogy in the statement, "the test of the pudding is in the eating." C.

                            24. The Chef and the Performer It is premise that since food requires careful preparation and special skills, it should not just be brought to the table on a platter. Instead, it should be the subject of a performance. Thus, the table becomes the stage; the chef, the performer; and the diners, the audience. The performance starts when the chef puts on his red hat and begins to act his part, he cuts the vegetables with spritely movements, tosses in some seasoning, and then attends to the meat, the fish, or the seafood on hand. The vegetables dance on the grills at the chef's command and jump into the diner's plate. Applause or an encore maybe inevitable, but of course, the test of the pudding is in eating.
