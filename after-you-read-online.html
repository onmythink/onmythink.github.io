Sustainability is the practice of meeting our current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p><p></p><p>There are many ways we can contribute to sustainability in our daily lives. One way is by reducing our consumption and waste. This can be as simple as bringing our own reusable bags to the grocery store, or choosing to buy products that are made from recycled materials. We can also reduce our energy consumption by turning off lights and appliances when they are not in use, and by using energy-efficient products.</p><p></p><p>Another way to contribute to sustainability is by supporting local businesses and buying locally-grown produce. This helps to reduce the carbon emissions associated with transportation and supports the local economy.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, sustainability is important for the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants. By making small changes in our daily lives, we can all contribute to a more sustainable future. Thank you."</p><br />

Both cultures are influenced by Asian and Western culture. Korea and the Philippines were both invaded by Japan during the WWII era, as with most Asian countries. Korean culture like Filipino culture has been influenced by interaction with other cultures, technology and the natural instinct of self-preservation.
