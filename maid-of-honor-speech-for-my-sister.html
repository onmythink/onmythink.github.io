                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sample</p><p>As you may know, I am the bride’s younger sister. As we were growing up, I always wanted to be like my big sis. Do the things she did, have the things she had — probably I was a bit annoying little sister, I always wanted to tag along. She was an amazing example for me: she taught me how to care, how to share and how to try to reach for the stars. And as I grew up I wanted to be just as beautiful, caring, smart and successful as her.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I was at my friend's wedding and the maid of honor out-staged the bride at the wedding. She chose to wear a sleek golden backless dress that sparkled and shined at the ceremony and reception. Everybody at my table just referred to her as the Academy Awards (Oscars) for the night. Also, no body knew if she was coming to the wedding or not because she dropped out of contact for a while other than a confirmation the week before that she will be there. The bride and groom were just happen when she finally showed up the night before the wedding.</p><br />
