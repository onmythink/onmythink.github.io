                                            . Let's Analyze Read and examine this statement of Missy Writes (2017) about the promotion of art in the Philippines. Afterwards, answer and do the following indicated questions and task. Write your answer on your answer sheet. "I believe that each agency has its own job that will help in keeping Philippine known to a lot of people not just here in the Philippines. I also believe that they are essential because nowadays, a lot of people are not that interested as before in local products and most especially the arts because they usually like foreign products. With these agencies, they keep Philippine art alive. Because of them, we learn to appreciate and love our own. And eventually, and hopefully in the future, we Filipinos will be able to promote and be proud of our own art, history, and culture" (Writes, 2017). ) 1) If you were given an opportunity to create an agency that would promote and preserve arts from the regions of the Philippines, what will be the name of the agency? 2) What will be the three main goals or focuses of the agency? 3) As a student, how will you promote traditional and contemporary Philippine arts? State three actions that you will do to promote traditional and contemporary Philippine arts.​</a>

But also how it functions to allow survival and reproduction.<strong>Archaeological anthropology, Archaeology is similar to anthropology in that it focuses on understanding human culture from the deepest history up until the recent past. </strong>It differs from anthropology in that it focuses specifically on analyzing material remains such as artifact and architectural remnants.<strong>Linguistic anthropology, Linguistic anthropology studies the nature of human languages in the context of those cultures that developed them. </strong>Scholars in the field seek to understand the social and cultural foundations of language itself, while exploring how social and cultural formations are grounded in linguistic practices.<strong>Applied Anthropology, </strong> Is the branch of antropology who sometimes called the "fifth sub-field"<strong>, applied anthropology is simply defined as the use of anthropological knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems.</strong><p></p><p><strong>So the correct pair of answers for the statement from branches of anthropology above is :</strong></p><strong>Sociocultural Anthropology</strong><strong>Archeological Anthropology</strong><strong>Applied Anthropology</strong><strong>Linguistic Anthropology </strong><strong>Physical or Biological Anthropology</strong><strong>Socio cultural Anthropology</strong><p></p><p><strong>Learn More About :</strong></p><p><strong>What is an Anthropology https://brainly.ph/question/2191579</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            14. 1. Examine the role of the state (government) in promoting a healthy ethical climate alongside economic
growth.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: The role of the state (government) in promoting a healthy ethical climate alongside economic growth is crucial for the sustainable development of a country. The government has a responsibility to ensure that ethical principles and values are upheld in all aspects of society, including the economy.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One way that the government can promote a healthy ethical climate is by enacting laws and regulations that encourage businesses to behave in an ethical manner. For example, the government can impose penalties on companies that engage in corrupt practices or violate ethical standards. This can include fines, loss of licenses, and even imprisonment for individuals involved in such activities.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another way that the government can promote ethical behavior is by setting up oversight bodies and regulatory agencies to monitor and enforce compliance with ethical standards. These agencies can investigate complaints, monitor the behavior of companies, and ensure that ethical standards are being upheld in all aspects of the economy.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In addition, the government can also promote ethical behavior through education and awareness campaigns. By promoting ethical principles and values through the education system, the government can help to instill these values in future generations. Similarly, public awareness campaigns can be used to raise awareness about the importance of ethical behavior in all aspects of society, including the economy.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Finally, the government can play a role in promoting ethical behavior by leading by example. By adopting and adhering to ethical principles in their own actions and policies, the government can set an example for the rest of society to follow.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Overall, the government plays a critical role in promoting a healthy ethical climate alongside economic growth. By enacting laws and regulations, setting up oversight bodies and regulatory agencies, promoting education and awareness, and leading by example, the government can help to ensure that ethical principles and values are upheld in all aspects of society, including the economy. This, in turn, can contribute to sustainable economic growth and the well-being of all citizens.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: my hand hurts</strong></p><p></p><br />
