Benefits and Hazards of Electromagnetic Waves, Telecommunications,
Physical and Biomedical: A Review
S. Batool, A. Bibi, F. Frezza, F. Mangini
Electromagnetic Radiations
Radiations consist of both electric and magnetic fields. They are coming from
natural and manmade resources. EMR is present in some scenario of everyone’s
life. Some of the most common sources of electromagnetic fields that everybody
experiences are the solar radiation, the electric current that supplies household
(Mobile Phone, Television set, Wi-Fi, Microwave, Computer, etc.) and antennas for
telecommunications. Artificial resources are used to generate high-level
electromagnetic radiations which may be typically found in medical devices such
as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), laser lithotripsy, X-ray Computed
Tomography (CT), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, Positron
Emission Tomography (PET) etc. In a residential environment, the diffusion of the
induction cooktop, hairdryers, cordless phones, modems, routers, appliances,
alarm system, etc. increases the possibility of domestic exposure to magnetic
fields. Nevertheless, electromagnetic fields can also be used for the treatment of
different diseases (e.g., cancer, kidney stones, gallstones, brain, liver etc.) The
practicality of above-described technologies is due to the range of frequencies
decreasing from ultra-high frequencies to extra low frequencies available in the
electromagnetic spectrum. This EMR spectrum includes ionizing and non-ionizing
radiations.
The health problems due to long-term effects of EMR from
telecommunication and biomedical devices have been addressed among the people
all over the world. The organizations like World Health Organization (WHO),
Federal Communication Commission (FCC), and International Commission on Non
-Ionization Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) have recommended some safety
guidelines for the protection of all living beings.
In the present review, we have examined several research papers, on living
beings like rats, cows, plants, and humans etc. By experimental strategies it was
identified that long-term effects of EMR can possibly cause different diseases in a
living being. Even if all those people are attentive to the long-term effects of EMR
hazard, they may not have the other option to move away from it, if the cell phone,
TV and FM tower are installed near their houses, schools, public transports, and
hospitals etc. But the matter is controversial.
Meanwhile, EMR has many advantages in biomedical and
telecommunication technologies. So, it is impossible for us to stop using these
radiations. However, researchers will try to find out the possible solutions, which
may be expensive. But we will easily reduce the health risk in all living being like
humans, animals, and birds</a>

Benefits and Hazards of Electromagnetic Waves, Telecommunications,
Physical and Biomedical: A Review
S. Batool, A. Bibi, F. Frezza, F. Mangini
Electromagnetic Radiations
Radiations consist of both electric and magnetic fields. They are coming from
natural and manmade resources. EMR is present in some scenario of everyone’s
life. Some of the most common sources of electromagnetic fields that everybody
experiences are the solar radiation, the electric current that supplies household
(Mobile Phone, Television set, Wi-Fi, Microwave, Computer, etc.) and antennas for
telecommunications. Artificial resources are used to generate high-level
electromagnetic radiations which may be typically found in medical devices such
as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), laser lithotripsy, X-ray Computed
Tomography (CT), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, Positron
Emission Tomography (PET) etc. In a residential environment, the diffusion of the
induction cooktop, hairdryers, cordless phones, modems, routers, appliances,
alarm system, etc. increases the possibility of domestic exposure to magnetic
fields. Nevertheless, electromagnetic fields can also be used for the treatment of
different diseases (e.g., cancer, kidney stones, gallstones, brain, liver etc.) The
practicality of above-described technologies is due to the range of frequencies
decreasing from ultra-high frequencies to extra low frequencies available in the
electromagnetic spectrum. This EMR spectrum includes ionizing and non-ionizing
radiations.
The health problems due to long-term effects of EMR from
telecommunication and biomedical devices have been addressed among the people
all over the world. The organizations like World Health Organization (WHO),
Federal Communication Commission (FCC), and International Commission on Non
-Ionization Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) have recommended some safety
guidelines for the protection of all living beings.
In the present review, we have examined several research papers, on living
beings like rats, cows, plants, and humans etc. By experimental strategies it was
identified that long-term effects of EMR can possibly cause different diseases in a
living being. Even if all those people are attentive to the long-term effects of EMR
hazard, they may not have the other option to move away from it, if the cell phone,
TV and FM tower are installed near their houses, schools, public transports, and
hospitals etc. But the matter is controversial.
Meanwhile, EMR has many advantages in biomedical and
telecommunication technologies. So, it is impossible for us to stop using these
radiations. However, researchers will try to find out the possible solutions, which
may be expensive. But we will easily reduce the health risk in all living being like
humans, animals, and birds</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer:</p><p>1.Electrical power supplies and appliances are the most common sources of low frequency electric and magnetic fields in our living environment. Everyday sources of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields are telecommunications, broadcasting antennas and microwave ovens.</p><p>2.The killing and destructive power of electromagnetic radiation can be used constructively for curing the incurable diseases by eradicating the disease producing pathogens and micro organisms like bacteria, virus &amp; fungi. </p><p>3.Over-exposure to certain types of electromagnetic radiation can be harmful. The higher the frequency of the radiation, the more damage it is likely to cause to the body: microwaves cause internal heating of body tissues. infrared radiation is felt as heat and causes skin to burn.</p><p>4. In fact, all living things on Earth depend on the electromagnetic radiation received from the Sun and on the transformation of solar energy by photosynthesis into plant life or by biosynthesis into zooplankton, the basic step in the food chain in oceans.</p><p>5. 1.       Limit sun exposure</p><p>    2.      Reduce cell phone use</p><p>    3.      Ditto for computers</p><p>    4.      Ground every day</p><p>    5.      Make your bedroom a sanctuary</p><p>    6.
