For the third time this week, a teacher was going to call her home and she knew that she wouldn't be able to talk her way out of this one. She thought that she would try anyway. "Come on, Mr. Jones," she pleaded. "I didn't mean to do it. I just held out my hand and he ran into it." Mr. Jones smirked and replied, "Yeah, nice try, Violet, but here's the deal. When one of my students gets hurt, we call homes and that's it." Violet buried her face in her palms.

12. The sun was beginning to set. Light rays pierced through the hills and I could see the stars awakening on the other side of the sky, but I did not want to go home. "Give me one more try. I'll get it this time," I pleaded with Jake. He tilted his head to the side, crinkled his face, and said, "Look, if you couldn't do it the last thousand times, you're probably not going to get it right now. Why don't you get your own skateboard, then you can work on your tricks all day and night?" He was right. I needed to get my own skateboard.

I could now see the hoop, but it was upside down. I held the ball against my inverted chest. "Come on, you know you can't do it. Just take the letter," Victor continued goading me but I wasn't trying to hear that nonsense. I wound back and released the ball. It flew from my hands in a perfect arc and soared directly over the backboard. "I told you so," Victor said smugly.

14. Hank brushed the sweat and dirt from his brow. He looked carefully at the crystal mass. These rocks had formed over millions of years. They were beautiful, but they were in the way of the gold. Hank spooled the wire out about twenty feet from the crystal mass. He took cover behind a cave wall and ordered the men to move back before he hit the switch. Boom! Crystal fragments exploded outward and settled on the cave floor. "All clear!" Hank shouted.

                                            Prepaid and Postpaid phone plans: What is the difference?
Jacqui Dent
A prepaid plan is a plan where you "recharge" your account at the start
of the billing cycle. Recharges come in a range of prices with varying
inclusions, and you are free to switch which recharge option you choose
every time you top up. It means you pay for your phone service upfront.
Prepaid recharges don't last forever. Most operate on a 28-day expiry
cycle and stipulate that any remaining inclusions are wiped clean when
you reach the end of the expiry period.
On the flip side, if you use up all of your credit before the end of the
expiry period, you will need to recharge your account before you can use
this part of your service again. For example, if you reach your data limit
your internet connection will pause, but you'll still be able to make and
receive calls and messages on plans with unlimited calling and text
inclusions.
A postpaid plan is a contract where you use your plan's inclusions, and
agree to pay the set price at the end of the billing cycle (usually on a
monthly basis).
On a postpaid plan, you pay at the end of the month based on your
usage. You choose a plan and every month your telco will bill you and
automatically refresh your plan inclusions on the first day of your billing
cycle. Postpaid plans can be SIM-only which means you only pay for the
phone service or they can come with a mobile phone included. Postpaid
plans almost always include unlimited talk and text, which means the
main point of difference is how much data you get.</a>

When a car overheats and stalls from vapor lock, follow these steps. First, if you are on the freeway, stay in your car. Wait until a member of the highway patrol comes to help you get to the side of the road. However, if it is safe to push the car to the side of the road by yourself, do it. Once you are at the side of the road, lift the hood and place a wet cloth on the fuel line and the fuel pump. If you do not have a wet rag then just sit there until things cool off. Once you have cooled the line so that the gasoline is no longer boiling, wrap the rag around the line. Better yet, carry some tinfoil in your car. Tinfoil. wrapped around the line, caries the heat away. When the car has cooled down, get back on the road, and act as though nothing had happened. (7 signal words) 2 If you are going to be recording a lot of tapes, it would be wise to follow these steps. Find a brand and type of tape that works well in your machine and stick with it. This will save you money in the long run, since tape is cheaper when bought by the case. Then, when unwrapping a new tape, fast-wind it all the way through and then rewind it back to the beginning. This will free up any sticking that may have developed in the tape while it was stored. Following this step, check the microphone and line level controls. If the recorder has separate controls, turn down the one for the input you're not using. to prevent unnecessary noise in recording. Finally, be sure that the recorder's bias and to switching are set to the correct position for the tape in use. (4 signal words) 3. Most children go through similar stages when they are beginning to talk According to linguists, first, babies learn to babble. Next, they speak in one word utterances. Following this stage; at about the age of one and a half or two years old, children are speaking in two word utterances. Subsequently, they are speaking in short sentences.

The free bird cries, 'O my love, let us fly to the wood.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Come hither, let us both live in the cage.'
Says the free bird, 'Among bars, where is there room to spread one's wings?'
'Alas,' cries the caged bird, 'I should not know where to sit perched in the sky.'
The free bird cries, 'My darling, sing the songs of the woodlands.'
The cage bird sings, 'Sit by my side, I'll teach you the speech of the learned.'
The forest bird cries, 'No, ah no! songs can never be taught.'
The cage bird says, 'Alas for me, I know not the songs of the woodlands.'
There love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing.
Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each
other.
They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, 'Come closer, my love!'
The free bird cries, 'It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of the cage.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.

                            4. 11. Violet pulled her hair back into a ponytail. She was stressed. For the third time this week, a teacher was going to call her home and she knew that she wouldn't be able to talk her way out of this one. She thought that she would try anyway. "Come on, Mr. Jones," she pleaded. "I didn't mean to do it. I just held out my hand and he ran into it." Mr. Jones smirked and replied, "Yeah, nice try, Violet, but here's the deal. When one of my students gets hurt, we call homes and that's it." Violet buried her face in her palms.

12. The sun was beginning to set. Light rays pierced through the hills and I could see the stars awakening on the other side of the sky, but I did not want to go home. "Give me one more try. I'll get it this time," I pleaded with Jake. He tilted his head to the side, crinkled his face, and said, "Look, if you couldn't do it the last thousand times, you're probably not going to get it right now. Why don't you get your own skateboard, then you can work on your tricks all day and night?" He was right. I needed to get my own skateboard.

13. "You can't do it. You'll never do it," said my cousin Victor as I stood at the free-throw line. I turned around so that my back was to the hoop and began bending backward. I could now see the hoop, but it was upside down. I held the ball against my inverted chest. "Come on, you know you can't do it. Just take the letter," Victor continued goading me but I wasn't trying to hear that nonsense. I wound back and released the ball. It flew from my hands in a perfect arc and soared directly over the backboard. "I told you so," Victor said smugly.

14. Hank brushed the sweat and dirt from his brow. He looked carefully at the crystal mass. These rocks had formed over millions of years. They were beautiful, but they were in the way of the gold. Hank spooled the wire out about twenty feet from the crystal mass. He took cover behind a cave wall and ordered the men to move back before he hit the switch. Boom! Crystal fragments exploded outward and settled on the cave floor. "All clear!" Hank shouted.

                            11. Prepaid and Postpaid phone plans: What is the difference?
Jacqui Dent
A prepaid plan is a plan where you "recharge" your account at the start
of the billing cycle. Recharges come in a range of prices with varying
inclusions, and you are free to switch which recharge option you choose
every time you top up. It means you pay for your phone service upfront.
Prepaid recharges don't last forever. Most operate on a 28-day expiry
cycle and stipulate that any remaining inclusions are wiped clean when
you reach the end of the expiry period.
On the flip side, if you use up all of your credit before the end of the
expiry period, you will need to recharge your account before you can use
this part of your service again. For example, if you reach your data limit
your internet connection will pause, but you'll still be able to make and
receive calls and messages on plans with unlimited calling and text
inclusions.
A postpaid plan is a contract where you use your plan's inclusions, and
agree to pay the set price at the end of the billing cycle (usually on a
monthly basis).
On a postpaid plan, you pay at the end of the month based on your
usage. You choose a plan and every month your telco will bill you and
automatically refresh your plan inclusions on the first day of your billing
cycle. Postpaid plans can be SIM-only which means you only pay for the
phone service or they can come with a mobile phone included. Postpaid
plans almost always include unlimited talk and text, which means the
main point of difference is how much data you get.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Prepaid, as the name implies, is a service that requires payment in advance. Every telecom provider in the country offers a diverse range of prepaid plans and add-ons to their customers. Any prepaid user can select any of the prepaid plans that meet their needs and recharge with add-on packs like top-ups as well as talktime top-ups if their prepaid plans are insufficient.</p><p></p><p>In a postpaid connection, users receive services from cellular providers and are then asked to pay the bill at the end of the billing cycle. Users, like prepaid subscribers, can select from a variety of postpaid plans offered by their operators. Their postpaid bill, as well as their consumption, will be covered by the plan they have chosen</p><br />

                            12. Encircle the time signal words in each paragraph. The number inside the parenthesis tells you how many answers are there in each paragraph. 1. When a car overheats and stalls from vapor lock, follow these steps. First, if you are on the freeway, stay in your car. Wait until a member of the highway patrol comes to help you get to the side of the road. However, if it is safe to push the car to the side of the road by yourself, do it. Once you are at the side of the road, lift the hood and place a wet cloth on the fuel line and the fuel pump. If you do not have a wet rag then just sit there until things cool off. Once you have cooled the line so that the gasoline is no longer boiling, wrap the rag around the line. Better yet, carry some tinfoil in your car. Tinfoil. wrapped around the line, caries the heat away. When the car has cooled down, get back on the road, and act as though nothing had happened. (7 signal words) 2 If you are going to be recording a lot of tapes, it would be wise to follow these steps. Find a brand and type of tape that works well in your machine and stick with it. This will save you money in the long run, since tape is cheaper when bought by the case. Then, when unwrapping a new tape, fast-wind it all the way through and then rewind it back to the beginning. This will free up any sticking that may have developed in the tape while it was stored. Following this step, check the microphone and line level controls. If the recorder has separate controls, turn down the one for the input you're not using. to prevent unnecessary noise in recording. Finally, be sure that the recorder's bias and to switching are set to the correct position for the tape in use. (4 signal words) 3. Most children go through similar stages when they are beginning to talk According to linguists, first, babies learn to babble. Next, they speak in one word utterances. Following this stage; at about the age of one and a half or two years old, children are speaking in two word utterances. Subsequently, they are speaking in short sentences. The actual age that children go through these stages varies but most follow a similar sequence signal words​</h2><br />

                            17. THE FREE BIRD AND THE CAGE BIRD
The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest.
They met when the time came, it was a decree of fate.
The free bird cries, 'O my love, let us fly to the wood.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Come hither, let us both live in the cage.'
Says the free bird, 'Among bars, where is there room to spread one's wings?'
'Alas,' cries the caged bird, 'I should not know where to sit perched in the sky.'
The free bird cries, 'My darling, sing the songs of the woodlands.'
The cage bird sings, 'Sit by my side, I'll teach you the speech of the learned.'
The forest bird cries, 'No, ah no! songs can never be taught.'
The cage bird says, 'Alas for me, I know not the songs of the woodlands.'
There love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing.
Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each
other.
They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, 'Come closer, my love!'
The free bird cries, 'It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of the cage.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.
