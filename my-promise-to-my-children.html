                                            Father Nael: (Priest)It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children? Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay)I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their relationship.

Which two sentences in this excerpt from Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Ann Jacobs express the view that even “kind” slaveholders regarded their slaves as merely property?
She had promised my dying mother that her children should never suffer for any thing; and when I remembered that, and recalled her many proofs of attachment to me, I could not help having some hopes that she had left me free.
…After a brief period of suspense, the will of my mistress was read, and we learned that she had bequeathed me to her sister's daughter, a child of five years old. So vanished our hopes.
…As a child, I loved my mistress; and, looking back on the happy days I spent with her, I try to think with less bitterness of this act of injustice. She possessed but few slaves; and at her death those were all distributed among her relatives. Five of them were my grandmother's children, and had shared the same milk that nourished her mother's children. Notwithstanding my grandmother's long and faithful service to her owners, not one of her children escaped the auction block.

                                            I. Read Luke 1: 39-56. (Luke 1: 39-56 NRSV - Mary Visits Elizabeth - In those days - Bible Gateway)
Answer the following questions: 
Who are the two people spoken about in today's Gospel?
What is about to happen to each of them? 
Remember that Elizabeth is the mother of John the Baptist. She was very old and had not yet had any children. But God chose her and Zechariah to be the parents of John the Baptist, who was to announce Jesus' coming. How does Mary respond to Elizabeth's greeting?
II. Read Mary's Magnificat (The Prayer of Mary) below.
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, 
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant. 
From this day all generations will call me blessed: 
the Almighty has done great things for me, 
and holy is his Name.
He has mercy on those who fear him
in every generation. 
He has shown the strength of his arm, 
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, 
and has lifted up the lowly. 
He has filled the hungry with good things, 
and the rich he has sent away empty.
He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he remembered his promise of mercy, 
the promise he made to our fathers, 
to Abraham and his children forever.
Answer the following questions: 
What are some of the things for which Mary praises God?
Using Mary's song of praise as a model, let's write a prayer of praise thanking God for the things that God is doing in our lives and in our world today.</a>

                                            Patricia and CJ happily follow their grandfather. It's Saturday morning and the sun beams brightly, promising a good weather for the day. It is indeed a great day to visit the farm!
Grandfather leads the children to the animal shelter. The children see the livestock animals. The children are amused when grandfather makes an unusual sound to get the animals' attention.
The animals hurriedly move to the feeding area. Grandfather serves their forage right away. The young sheep look adorable in their white thick wooly coat.
But suddenly, Patricia shouts, horrified! Grandfather and CJ look at her questioningly. "A mouse runs over my feet," says Patricia. "It's just a mouse, Patricial" exclaims CJ. Grandfather and CJ laugh
at her.
"Come on! Let's go to the vegetable farm," invites Grandfather. The children are satisfied seeing the different rows of vegetables. They spend an hour helping Grandfather harvest some vegetables.
After a while, they go home contentedly, asking grandfather to take them again to the farm next time.

                                            The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</a>

                            5. Father Nael: (Priest)It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children? Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay)I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their relationship. I would agree just for him to be happyActivity 2: My Personal Insights: After reading the six arguments on the given issues above, which do you think the best argument and why?

Which two sentences in this excerpt from Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Ann Jacobs express the view that even “kind” slaveholders regarded their slaves as merely property?
She had promised my dying mother that her children should never suffer for any thing; and when I remembered that, and recalled her many proofs of attachment to me, I could not help having some hopes that she had left me free.
…After a brief period of suspense, the will of my mistress was read, and we learned that she had bequeathed me to her sister's daughter, a child of five years old. So vanished our hopes.
…As a child, I loved my mistress; and, looking back on the happy days I spent with her, I try to think with less bitterness of this act of injustice. She possessed but few slaves; and at her death those were all distributed among her relatives. Five of them were my grandmother's children, and had shared the same milk that nourished her mother's children. Notwithstanding my grandmother's long and faithful service to her owners, not one of her children escaped the auction block.

Grandfather leads the children to the animal shelter. The children see the livestock animals. The children are amused when grandfather makes an unusual sound to get the animals' attention.
The animals hurriedly move to the feeding area. Grandfather serves their forage right away. The young sheep look adorable in their white thick wooly coat.
But suddenly, Patricia shouts, horrified! Grandfather and CJ look at her questioningly. "A mouse runs over my feet," says Patricia. "It's just a mouse, Patricial" exclaims CJ. Grandfather and CJ laugh
at her.
"Come on! Let's go to the vegetable farm," invites Grandfather. The children are satisfied seeing the different rows of vegetables. They spend an hour helping Grandfather harvest some vegetables.
After a while, they go home contentedly, asking grandfather to take them again to the farm next time.

                            27. The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</h2><br />
