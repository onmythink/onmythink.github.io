                                            A GREAT LIVING ROOMMy living room may be small, but it is tidy and well organized. On the right, there is a wooden bookcase with four shelves, On top of the bookcase is a small lamp with a dark base and a matching lamp shade. The first and third shelves are filled with carefully arranged books, On the second shelf, there is a antique clock with faded numbers on its face. The bottom shelf has a few newspapers. On the opposite side of the room is an old television set with nothing on top of it. Between the television and the bookcase is a large sofa. A fat, striped cat with long whiskers is curled up in a ball on the right on the right side of the sofa. Lying to the left of my cat is a single sock that the cat probably brought from another room. Directly in front of the sofa, there is a long coffee table lie two magazines. They are stacked one on top of the other. Perhaps the most striking item in the room is the beautiful beach painting above the sofa. This extraordinary painting shows a peaceful beach scene with a sailboat on the right, far from the beach. Although it is a small room, everything in my living room is in its place.1. What does the paragraph describe?2. Describe the ambiance conveyed in the room?3.

There were three swimming pools in addition tothe beach by the ocean. Getting a towel was the big problem. An in-room sign read,Please do not take bath towels to the pool or beach; towels are available there.Except there were no towels for two days straight. The attendant said that the laundry couldn'tkeep up with the demand because the house was full. It was true the beach and the pools werepacked with crowds! So, the children took towels from their bath on their final day. Kids! Both lefttheir towels on the beach.The family's upbeat vacation and positive image of the resort took a wide U-turn whenthey found a $22 charge on the bill for two towels missing from Room 319.

                            12. A Great Living Room
My living room may be small, but it is tidy and well-organized. On the right, there is a wooden bookcase with four shelves. On top of the bookcase is a small lamp with a dark base and a matching lamp shade. The first and third shelves are filled with carefully arranged books. On the second shelf, there is an antique clock with faded numbers on its face. The bottom shelf has a few newspapers. On the opposite side of the room is an old television set with nothing on top of it. Between the television and the bookcase is a large sofa. A fat, stripped cat with long whiskers is curled up in a ball on the right side of the sofa. Lying to the left of my cat is a single sock that the cat probably brought from another room. Directly in front of the sofa, there is a long coffee table with short legs. On the right side of this table lie two magazines. They are stacked one on top of the other. Perhaps the most striking item in the room is the beautiful beach painting above the sofa. This extraordinary painting shows a peaceful beach scene with a sailboat on the right, far from the beach. Although it is a small room, everything in my living room is in its place.

                            14. what are the intertidal beaches? discuss each beach​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>On the shore between high and low tide lies the intertidal zone, where land and sea meet. The intertidal zone is underwater during high tide and exposed to air during low tide. The animals and plants that live in this zone must cope with being submerged in water and exposed to the air during different times of the day. Many species of worms, snails, clams, oysters, mussels, and sea stars make the intertidal zone their home. Rocky shores and sandy beaches fall within the intertidal zone. The motion of high tide and low tide creates four zones within the intertidal zone where different animals and plants live.
</p><p>
</p>Spray Zone
<p>
The spray zone is the upper part of the beach that occasionally gets splashed but never gets covered by the ocean. This zone is more a part of the land than the ocean. Plants and animals in the spray zone have adapted to living exposed to the air, sun, rain, and even frost.
</p><p>
</p>High Intertidal Zone
<p>
The high intertidal zone is flooded during the peaks of the once or twice daily high tides, and out of the water for long stretches of time in between. Here plants and animals are used to living above the water surface.
</p><p>
</p>Mid Intertidal Zone
<p>
The middle intertidal zone is generally submerged, except for a period during the turn of low tide. More plants and animals live here because they are not exposed to drying conditions for too long.
</p><p>
</p>Low Intertidal Zone
<p>
The lower intertidal zone is exposed to air for only a short period of time at low tide. Life here is adapted to conditions underwater.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            21. A particular beach is eroding at a rate of 4 centimeters per year. A realtor converts this rate to millimeters per day. Which expression, when evaluated, results in the correct units and numerical value?</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>0.11 mm/day</p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong><p>We know that every year, the beach erodes by 4 centimeters. However, what we want to know is how many millimeters the beach erodes every day.  (Please check this out for help on conversion: <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2085499</strong>)</p><p>We can approach this problem by breaking down the problem to two steps. <strong>First, we figure out how much the beach erodes per year, </strong><strong>but in millimeters</strong>. To do this, we multiply 4 cm/year by the conversion factor, 10 mm/cm:</p><p>[tex]4 \frac{\text{cm}}{\text{year}} \times \frac{10 \text{ mm}}{1 \text{ cm}} = 40 \frac{\text{mm}}{\text{year}}[/tex]</p><p>Therefore, we know that the beach erodes 40 millimeters per year. <strong>Now, we want to know how much the beach erodes </strong><strong>per day</strong><strong>, also in millimeters.</strong> We already have a rate in millimeters, but it is expressed in years and not days. To express the rate in terms of days, we use the fact that there are 365 days in a year (see <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/105654</strong>).</p><p>[tex]40 \frac{\text{mm}}{\text{year}} \times \frac{1 \text{ year}}{365 \text{ days}} = 0.10959\frac{\text{mm}}{\text{day}}[/tex]</p><p>Rounding off our answer based on significant figures, we get a rate of around 0.1 mm/day. (See help on significant figures here: <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1786615</strong>)</p>Tip<p>Regardless of the method, to convert rates, we should identify:</p>the <strong>units </strong>of the value that is <strong>given</strong>the <strong>units</strong> of the value that is <strong>unknown</strong>the <strong>conversion factors</strong> of units in our rates<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Our eyes are not sensitive to infrared radiation so we do not see it. Cold bodies radiate mostly in the infrared zone (invisible to the human eye), but as the temperature increases the body will emmit higher frequencies with more intensity. So room temperature obects will not be seen due to black body radiation.</p><p>2.
