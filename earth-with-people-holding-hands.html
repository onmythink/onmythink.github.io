                                            Activity 4. Read the texts and do the tasks after each. For number 1 While on a vacation, you meet new people from new places. But when you stay home and read, you meet even more people from places. Sometimes, the newfound from them. But when you get annoyed by the people you meet through books, all you have to 1. Which statement is supported by the evidence in the text? A. Going on a vacation is more exciting than reading books at home. B. Going on a vacation and reading books at home are no fun at all. C. Reading books at home is more exciting than going on a vacation. D. Reading books at home is as much fun as going on a vacation. For number 2 Since ancient times, constellations are always helpful to people. They used the appearance of certain stars to forecast the weather. When stars are visible, they expect fair weather. But, when stars are behind the clouds, the next day may be cloudy or rainy Constellations are helpful to navigators. Navigators use their knowledge in astronomy in the conduct of their work. When the navigators are lost at sea, they refer to Polaris, which is in Ursa Minor. They use Polaris as their guiding star. Polaris is a fixed star. It is located at the north. By using Polaris, it is easy to find south, east, and west directions. 2. Which of the following statements is supported in the text? A. Constellations are helpful to ancient people and the navigators. B. Constellations are helpful to ancient people not the navigators. C. Constellations are helpful to navigators not the ancient people. D. Constellations are not helpful to ancient people or the navigators. For number 3 *Gravitational forces exist between the moon and Earth to hold each other in their respective positions. These gravitational forces affect Earth's tides. Tides are the rising and falling of the sea levels with respect to land. "Imagine the moon as a magnet and Earth as a huge metal. 5When one side of the Earth is close to the moon, the side of the Earth will be pulled towards the moon, causing it to bulge. Since Earth is covered with 75% of water, this bulging side causes the ocean level to rise. ?The rising of ocean level is known as high tide. Son the other hand, the other side experiences low water level since the water is concentrated on the other side. This is known as low tide. 3. Which evidence supports the claim that "The gravitational forces between the moon and the earth affect the tides of the earth?" A. Sentence 1 B. Sentence 5 C. Sentence 7 D. Sentence 9​</a>

The surface of the Earth is divided into pieces called "tectonic plates." These plates move. When the plates rub against each other, they do not move smoothly. When the plates do not move smoothly, earthquakes result. Some parts of the world get more earthquakes than other parts. The parts of the earth that get most earthquakes are near the edges of these plates.4. The twist is a dance inspired by rock and roll music. To do the Twist, first stand with your feet approximately shoulder width apart. The torso may be squared to the knees and hips, or turned at an angle so one foot is farther forward than the other. Then, hold your arms out from your body, bent at your elbow. Next, rotate your hips, torso, and legs as a single unit with your arms staying more or less stationary. Every so often lift one leg off of the floor for styling. Now you're doing the twist!5. Sparklers and smoke bombs are my favorite kinds of fireworks. They are both safe and fun but they are also quite different. After you light a smoke bomb, you should put it on the ground and run. Stand back and watch it go! When you light a sparkler, however, you continue to hold it until it is done sparkling. You're your hand around and have an awesome time! They also burn differently. Sparklers create bright lights and sparks when you light them, but smoke bombs create smoke in different colors, Remember kids: smoke bombs and sparklers are both extremely dangerous and should only be used by professionals,​</a>

                                             Direction: Read and understand the selection carefully and answer the questions that follows. 8 a At the Coal Mine By Julie Haydon Amine is a hole in the earth; people dig mines to look for rocks, such as coal. Some mines have tunnels that go deep under the ground. A miner is a person who works in a mine. Some coal miners work in dark tunnels, deep under the ground. A mine is a dangerous place. Miners wear special clothing to keep saf. Once, coal mining was done by hand. Miners worked in the dark for many hours. They dug the coal out with hand tools. Today, mining is done with machines. There are important safety rules in mines. Rule 1: Miners must be able to breathe fresh air. Rule 2: Strong beams hold up the mine roof so that it will not fall on the miners. After the coal is cut, it is taken out of the mine. A moving belt carries the coal out of the min. Not all coal miners work under the ground. The miners dig for coal that is close to the ground. First, the soil is removed from the ground. Then, big machines scoop the coal out of the ground. At the power station, the crusa coal is burnt. The burning coal heats water and makes it boil. Boiling water makes steam. The steam turns a generator. This makes electricity. 1. What is a mine and where do the miners work? 2. How did the miners work in the past? 3. What are the safety rules of mines? 4. What is the modern tool of mining? . 5. What does happen after the coal is cut?​</a>

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</a>

When a river receives a lot of extra water it may flood. During a flood there is plenty of water, and most people wouldn't think that dehydration was a serious risk, but flood waters are mostly polluted and not safe to drink. People who drink the contaminated water may suffer from illnesses or diseases such as typhoid. You can prepare for flooding by filling many containers with fresh clean drinking water. You can also usesandbags to protect your house and to soak up the water. Be prepared and be safe 2. There are many reasons why people dance. Some people dance for fun, just because they enjoy dancing. At other times, people dance for exercise or for weight loss, because dancing can really get your heart beating. Also, sometimes people dance to try to get boyfriends or girlfriends. Some people think that good dancing is attractive. There are many reasons why people dance. 3. The surface of the Earth is divided into pieces called "tectonic plates. These plates move. When the plates rub against each other, they do not move smoothly. When the plates do not move smoothly, earthquakes result. Some parts of the world get more earthquakes than other parts. The parts of the earth that get most earthquakes are near the edges of these plates. 4. The twist is a dance inspired by rock and roll music. To do the Twist, first stand with your feet approdimately shoulder width apart. The torso may be squared to the knees and hips, or turned at an angle so one foot is farther forward than the other. Then, hold your arms out from your body, bent at your elbow. Next, rotate your hips torso, and legs as a single unit with your arms staying more or less stationary. Every so often lift one leg off of the floor for styling. Now you're doing the twist! 5. Sparklers and smoke bombs are my favorite kinds of fireworks. They are both safe and fun but they are also quite different. After you light a smoke bomb, you should put it on the ground and run. Stand back and watch it go! When you light a sparkler, however, you continue to hold it until it is done sparkling. You're your hand around and have an awesome time! They also burn differently. Sparklers create bright lights and sparks when you light them, but smoke bombs create smoke in different colors. Remember kids: smoke bombs and sparklers are both extremely dangerous and should only be used by professionals. a​</a>

Equally important, is tostrengthen one’s immune system by eating healthy and nutritious food, having enoughrest and sleep, as well as doing healthy exercises.

OgeinamBowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilienceare again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one isexempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying7loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also, on a lighter note,it came as a great global equalizer.This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and severaluniversal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary.Our life, our wealth, and all possessions we have, including our own skills andknowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even themost powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything isunpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation,we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go, and our social connectionsand interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations, and all things we hold dearly,with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftlybecomes volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA worldwhere all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change.And the very question is, “Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on thegovernment, family, and friends for help?As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More thanever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faithto a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps usgoing¢ and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and hugechanges in this “new normal”. We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, wecontinue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive always. We learn how to look at thebrighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, ourfaith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life’s challenges. Therefore, let us holdonto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble norfear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of virusessuch as this COVID-19.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME4.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE5.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER6.)______________</a>

                                            The Good Prince Bantugan An old king ruled over the kingdom of Bumbaran. His kingdom was prosperous, his people were good;; and he should have been very happy. But the king was not contented. His heart was full of envy toward his younger brother, Prince Bantugan. Every time someone praised Prince Bantugan, the king frowned and looked angry. "Prince Bantugan is so handsome," he often heard the women say, and he would look in a mirror and see with sorrow that he was not good-looking. "Prince Bantugan is so good, other people said, and the king grew more angrily because he knew that he was not as good as his brother either. "Prince Bantugan is so brave," everybody said. The king grew tired of people saying so many good things about his brother while they said nothing nice about him. The young ladies smiled at Prince Bantugan. They allowed him to hold their hands. and they gave him their love. But they did not like the older brother, the king. One day enemies attacked the kingdom of Bumbaran, and Prince Bantugan led his soldiers to defend the country. While he was gone, the evil king plotted against the good prince. He issued a proclamation that no one should speak to Prince Bantugan. He added that whoever dared to speak to Bantugan would be killed. Soon Prince Bantugan returned victorious from the battle. To his astonishment no one met him, no one praised him, and no one even wanted to speak to him. This saddened the good prince. He knew that his brother hated him, so he decided to leave Bumbaran. He preferred to live in other countries and to travel to far lands and forget about his unkind brother. In his travels he heard about the beautiful land of the Kingdom-Between-Two- Seas. It was ruled by a good, kind king and his sister, the beautiful and kind Princess Datimbang. Prince Bantugan decided to go there. He traveled through forests and across rivers and mountains and at last reached the Kingdom-Between-Two-Seas. Prince Bantugan became very weary from his travels. As he stood outside the gates of the great palace, he suddenly felt very weak. His legs could not carry his body, and the prince fell to the ground and died. The parrot flew ahead to the kingdom of Bumbaran. When he told the king about the death of Prince Bantugan, the ladies shrieked and tore their hair and fainted. Everyone grieved for the Good Prince Bantugan. Even the king, his brother, was stricken with remorse and pain. He was full of repentance. He blamed himself for the death of his brother. He did not know what to do. Prince Madali was brother of Prince Bantugan and loved him dearly. He volunteered to go to the region of the dead and bring Bantugan's soul back to his body. The king decided to go with him. It was a very dangerous journey, but the two were not afraid. They rode on their magic shields and rode up to the sky. For five days they flew. They reached the place of lightning, thunder, and endless rain. Five more days they travelled. They reached the land of burning heat. Their magic shields almost melted under them. So great was the distance that they went on for five more days. At last they reached the highest portals of the sky. The keeper of the gate asked them, "Why are you here? What do you want? "We have come to ask the angel of Death when we shall die and when the end of the world will come," the young man answered. "Go to the next door," the gatekeeper told them. "You will find the angel who guards the soul of the dead there." "Why are you here?" asked the guard. "You have no business here." You are not dead." "We have come to ask the Angel of Death when we shall die." Prince Madali answered. "Come in but only for a minute," the guardian said opening the door. "Then you must return to earth right away." The two entered and found themselves in a beautiful garden full of fragrant flowers and delicious fruits. On a large table were bottles of different colors which contained the souls of the dead. The two tricked the Angel of Death to go out for a minute. As soon as the angel was out of the room, Prince Madali whispered softly, "Bantugan, my brother where are you?" am From a large blue bottle near them, the voice of Prince Bantugan answered, "I here." Prince Madali seized the bottle and away the young men flew back to earth. When they reached the palace, the king and the princess of the Kingdom- Between Two Seas were just landing with the body of Prince Bantugan. Prince Madali transferred the soul of Prince Bantugan from the bottle to his body. The body stirred. Then Prince Bantugan sat up and stretched out as if just awakening from a deep sleep. The people shouted with joy. For many days they celebrated the return of their beloved prince. Later, Prince Bantugan married the beautiful Princess Datimbang Character traitstittle:trait/evidence:trait/evidence:trait/evidence:​</a>

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</a>

For number 3 *Gravitational forces exist between the moon and Earth to hold each other in their respective positions. These gravitational forces affect Earth's tides. Tides are the rising and falling of the sea levels with respect to land. "Imagine the moon as a magnet and Earth as a huge metal. 5When one side of the Earth is close to the moon, the side of the Earth will be pulled towards the moon, causing it to bulge. Since Earth is covered with 75% of water, this bulging side causes the ocean level to rise. ?The rising of ocean level is known as high tide. Son the other hand, the other side experiences low water level since the water is concentrated on the other side. This is known as low tide. 3.

During a flood there is plenty of water, and most people wouldn't think that dehydration was a serious risk, but flood waters are mostly polluted and not safe to drink. People who drink the contaminated water may suffer from illnesses or diseases such as typhoid. You can prepare for flooding by filling many containers with fresh clean drinking water. You can also use sandbags to protect your house and to soak up the water. Be prepared and be safe.2. There are many reasons why people dance. Some people dance for fun, just because they enjoy dancing. At other times, people dance for exercise or for weight loss, because dancing can really get your heart beating. Also, sometimes people dance to try to get boyfriends or girlfriends. Some people think that good dancing is attractive. There are many reasons why people dance.3. The surface of the Earth is divided into pieces called "tectonic plates." These plates move. When the plates rub against each other, they do not move smoothly. When the plates do not move smoothly, earthquakes result. Some parts of the world get more earthquakes than other parts. The parts of the earth that get most earthquakes are near the edges of these plates.4. The twist is a dance inspired by rock and roll music. To do the Twist, first stand with your feet approximately shoulder width apart. The torso may be squared to the knees and hips, or turned at an angle so one foot is farther forward than the other. Then, hold your arms out from your body, bent at your elbow. Next, rotate your hips, torso, and legs as a single unit with your arms staying more or less stationary. Every so often lift one leg off of the floor for styling. Now you're doing the twist!5. Sparklers and smoke bombs are my favorite kinds of fireworks. They are both safe and fun but they are also quite different. After you light a smoke bomb, you should put it on the ground and run. Stand back and watch it go! When you light a sparkler, however, you continue to hold it until it is done sparkling. You're your hand around and have an awesome time! They also burn differently. Sparklers create bright lights and sparks when you light them, but smoke bombs create smoke in different colors, Remember kids: smoke bombs and sparklers are both extremely dangerous and should only be used by professionals,​</h2><br />

                            7.  Direction: Read and understand the selection carefully and answer the questions that follows. 8 a At the Coal Mine By Julie Haydon Amine is a hole in the earth; people dig mines to look for rocks, such as coal. Some mines have tunnels that go deep under the ground. A miner is a person who works in a mine. Some coal miners work in dark tunnels, deep under the ground. A mine is a dangerous place. Miners wear special clothing to keep saf. Once, coal mining was done by hand. Miners worked in the dark for many hours. They dug the coal out with hand tools. Today, mining is done with machines. There are important safety rules in mines. Rule 1: Miners must be able to breathe fresh air. Rule 2: Strong beams hold up the mine roof so that it will not fall on the miners. After the coal is cut, it is taken out of the mine. A moving belt carries the coal out of the min. Not all coal miners work under the ground. The miners dig for coal that is close to the ground. First, the soil is removed from the ground. Then, big machines scoop the coal out of the ground. At the power station, the crusa coal is burnt. The burning coal heats water and makes it boil. Boiling water makes steam. The steam turns a generator. This makes electricity. 1. What is a mine and where do the miners work? 2. How did the miners work in the past? 3. What are the safety rules of mines? 4. What is the modern tool of mining? . 5. What does happen after the coal is cut?​</h2><br />

                            8. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</h2><br />

When a river receives a lot of extra water it may flood. During a flood there is plenty of water, and most people wouldn't think that dehydration was a serious risk, but flood waters are mostly polluted and not safe to drink. People who drink the contaminated water may suffer from illnesses or diseases such as typhoid. You can prepare for flooding by filling many containers with fresh clean drinking water. You can also usesandbags to protect your house and to soak up the water. Be prepared and be safe 2. There are many reasons why people dance. Some people dance for fun, just because they enjoy dancing. At other times, people dance for exercise or for weight loss, because dancing can really get your heart beating. Also, sometimes people dance to try to get boyfriends or girlfriends. Some people think that good dancing is attractive. There are many reasons why people dance. 3. The surface of the Earth is divided into pieces called "tectonic plates. These plates move. When the plates rub against each other, they do not move smoothly. When the plates do not move smoothly, earthquakes result. Some parts of the world get more earthquakes than other parts. The parts of the earth that get most earthquakes are near the edges of these plates. 4. The twist is a dance inspired by rock and roll music. To do the Twist, first stand with your feet approdimately shoulder width apart. The torso may be squared to the knees and hips, or turned at an angle so one foot is farther forward than the other. Then, hold your arms out from your body, bent at your elbow. Next, rotate your hips torso, and legs as a single unit with your arms staying more or less stationary. Every so often lift one leg off of the floor for styling. Now you're doing the twist! 5. Sparklers and smoke bombs are my favorite kinds of fireworks. They are both safe and fun but they are also quite different. After you light a smoke bomb, you should put it on the ground and run. Stand back and watch it go! When you light a sparkler, however, you continue to hold it until it is done sparkling. You're your hand around and have an awesome time! They also burn differently. Sparklers create bright lights and sparks when you light them, but smoke bombs create smoke in different colors. Remember kids: smoke bombs and sparklers are both extremely dangerous and should only be used by professionals. a​</h2><br />

Currently, the best ways for people not tocontract the virus are to observe proper hygiene, frequent hand washing, and use ofmask and alcohol anytime, anywhere, and everywhere they go. Equally important, is tostrengthen one’s immune system by eating healthy and nutritious food, having enoughrest and sleep, as well as doing healthy exercises.

OgeinamBowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilienceare again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one isexempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying7loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also, on a lighter note,it came as a great global equalizer.This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and severaluniversal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary.Our life, our wealth, and all possessions we have, including our own skills andknowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even themost powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything isunpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation,we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go, and our social connectionsand interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations, and all things we hold dearly,with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftlybecomes volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA worldwhere all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change.And the very question is, “Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on thegovernment, family, and friends for help?As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More thanever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faithto a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps usgoing¢ and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and hugechanges in this “new normal”. We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, wecontinue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive always. We learn how to look at thebrighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, ourfaith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life’s challenges. Therefore, let us holdonto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble norfear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of virusessuch as this COVID-19.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME4.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE5.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER6.)______________</h2><br />

                            15. The Good Prince Bantugan An old king ruled over the kingdom of Bumbaran. His kingdom was prosperous, his people were good;; and he should have been very happy. But the king was not contented. His heart was full of envy toward his younger brother, Prince Bantugan. Every time someone praised Prince Bantugan, the king frowned and looked angry. "Prince Bantugan is so handsome," he often heard the women say, and he would look in a mirror and see with sorrow that he was not good-looking. "Prince Bantugan is so good, other people said, and the king grew more angrily because he knew that he was not as good as his brother either. "Prince Bantugan is so brave," everybody said. The king grew tired of people saying so many good things about his brother while they said nothing nice about him. The young ladies smiled at Prince Bantugan. They allowed him to hold their hands. and they gave him their love. But they did not like the older brother, the king. One day enemies attacked the kingdom of Bumbaran, and Prince Bantugan led his soldiers to defend the country. While he was gone, the evil king plotted against the good prince. He issued a proclamation that no one should speak to Prince Bantugan. He added that whoever dared to speak to Bantugan would be killed. Soon Prince Bantugan returned victorious from the battle. To his astonishment no one met him, no one praised him, and no one even wanted to speak to him. This saddened the good prince. He knew that his brother hated him, so he decided to leave Bumbaran. He preferred to live in other countries and to travel to far lands and forget about his unkind brother. In his travels he heard about the beautiful land of the Kingdom-Between-Two- Seas. It was ruled by a good, kind king and his sister, the beautiful and kind Princess Datimbang. Prince Bantugan decided to go there. He traveled through forests and across rivers and mountains and at last reached the Kingdom-Between-Two-Seas. Prince Bantugan became very weary from his travels. As he stood outside the gates of the great palace, he suddenly felt very weak. His legs could not carry his body, and the prince fell to the ground and died. The parrot flew ahead to the kingdom of Bumbaran. When he told the king about the death of Prince Bantugan, the ladies shrieked and tore their hair and fainted. Everyone grieved for the Good Prince Bantugan. Even the king, his brother, was stricken with remorse and pain. He was full of repentance. He blamed himself for the death of his brother. He did not know what to do. Prince Madali was brother of Prince Bantugan and loved him dearly. He volunteered to go to the region of the dead and bring Bantugan's soul back to his body. The king decided to go with him. It was a very dangerous journey, but the two were not afraid. They rode on their magic shields and rode up to the sky. For five days they flew. They reached the place of lightning, thunder, and endless rain. Five more days they travelled. They reached the land of burning heat. Their magic shields almost melted under them. So great was the distance that they went on for five more days. At last they reached the highest portals of the sky. The keeper of the gate asked them, "Why are you here? What do you want? "We have come to ask the angel of Death when we shall die and when the end of the world will come," the young man answered. "Go to the next door," the gatekeeper told them. "You will find the angel who guards the soul of the dead there." "Why are you here?" asked the guard. "You have no business here." You are not dead." "We have come to ask the Angel of Death when we shall die." Prince Madali answered. "Come in but only for a minute," the guardian said opening the door. "Then you must return to earth right away." The two entered and found themselves in a beautiful garden full of fragrant flowers and delicious fruits. On a large table were bottles of different colors which contained the souls of the dead. The two tricked the Angel of Death to go out for a minute. As soon as the angel was out of the room, Prince Madali whispered softly, "Bantugan, my brother where are you?" am From a large blue bottle near them, the voice of Prince Bantugan answered, "I here." Prince Madali seized the bottle and away the young men flew back to earth. When they reached the palace, the king and the princess of the Kingdom- Between Two Seas were just landing with the body of Prince Bantugan. Prince Madali transferred the soul of Prince Bantugan from the bottle to his body. The body stirred. Then Prince Bantugan sat up and stretched out as if just awakening from a deep sleep. The people shouted with joy. For many days they celebrated the return of their beloved prince. Later, Prince Bantugan married the beautiful Princess Datimbang Character traitstittle:trait/evidence:trait/evidence:trait/evidence:​</h2><br />

                            16. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</h2><br />
