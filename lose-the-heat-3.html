                                            Heat
Heat energy is the energy of molecules in random motion or motion with no
particular direction. If heat energy is added to matter or substance, its molecules move
faster and the substance becomes hotter. If matter loses heat energy, its molecules
move faster and the substance becomes hotter. If matter loses heat energy, its
molecules move slow and the substance become colder.
Heat is energy that travels from warm bodies to cooler bodies. The states of matter can
be explained according to this theory. When enough heat is added to a solid, its
molecules move faster until it melts and becomes liquid. If more heat is added, its
molecules move even faster and become a gas. Heat also affects gas pressure.
Adding heat increases the speed of the gas molecules and the force with which these
molecules exert on the walls of their container.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2.D</p><p>3.C</p><p>4.C</p><p>5.B</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>2.The more practical definition of temperature is the average kinetic energy of all molecules in an object.Since molecules gaining thermal energy increases their speed of vibration and therefore kinetic energy,a gain of thermal energy is accompanied by gain in temperature.Since the water gains thermal energy by heat transfer,they become more violent in vibrating,thereby increasing both their thermal energy and temperature.</p><p></p><p>3.According to the laws of thermodynamics,energy always flow from higher entropy to lower entropy.In simple terms,a hot object has more entropy since its molecules are vibrsting violently and thereby scattered all around,and a cold object have lower entropy since its molecules are much slower moving and thereby much more organized.Since the laws of thermodynamics take effect on any energy transfer,the heat from the boiling water will be transferred into the cold metal via colliding with each other.The hot water molecules collide with cold metal's molecules,thereby transferring its energy until an equilibrium is reached or satisfied.</p><p></p><p>4.In density,the term refers to unit of mass per unit volume.It means the bigger the volume,the lesser the density and vice versa.When we heat up objects,the molecules vibrate much faster and therefore occupy more space,giving birth to a phenomenon called Thermal Expansion.Since the vibrating molecules occupy more space,more volume is added regardless of mass.In the case of air,the air absorbs energy from Sun's radiation and therefore vibrate more violently,undergoing thermal expansion and expanding its volume.We know that less dense objecsmts float above more dense objects.Since hot air has bigger volume,its density compared to the surrounding air is lesser,thereby it floats.On the other hand,the atmosphere lowers in temperature as altitude increases,so the once hot air becomes colder,and sinks back to the ground.After they reach the ground,they are heated up again and the cycle repeats,which gives birth to air circulation.</p><p></p><p>5.For a phase change to occur,a molecule must have absorbed enough heat to overcome the attraction of its neighboring molecules,thus breaking stronger cohesion into weaker cohesion.This happens by absorbing energy,in any way.Since molecules vibrate more violently as more energy is absorbed,it will eventually reach a limit where its cohesion will break,transforming it into other state of matter or phase.In a case of wet clothes,the water in the clothes is slow moving.After being exposed to sunlight,they absorb energy,and if long enough,they will gain enough energy to undergo phase change from liquid to gas.</p><br />

                            14. Heat
Heat energy is the energy of molecules in random motion or motion with no
particular direction. If heat energy is added to matter or substance, its molecules move
faster and the substance becomes hotter. If matter loses heat energy, its molecules
move faster and the substance becomes hotter. If matter loses heat energy, its
molecules move slow and the substance become colder.
Heat is energy that travels from warm bodies to cooler bodies. The states of matter can
be explained according to this theory. When enough heat is added to a solid, its
molecules move faster until it melts and becomes liquid. If more heat is added, its
molecules move even faster and become a gas. Heat also affects gas pressure.
Adding heat increases the speed of the gas molecules and the force with which these
molecules exert on the walls of their container.

                            29. 1. What happens to the movements of the particles as they gain kineticenergy?2. What happens to the movement of particles as they loses kineticenergy?3. How would you describe the change in the arrangement of particles as heatenergy and temperature increase?pa help po pleaseee...​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>With an increase in temperature, the particles move faster as they gain kinetic energy, resulting in increased collision rates and an increased rate of diffusion. In a solid, the particles pack together as tightly as possible in a neat and ordered arrangement.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>When a sample of solid, liquid, or gas matter cools down, it contracts. When matter cools down, its particles lose kinetic energy. The decreased kinetic energy lets the particles come closer together. This causes the matter to contract.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>With an increase in temperature, the particles move faster as they gain kinetic energy, resulting in increased collision rates and an increased rate of diffusion. ... With an increase in temperature, the particles gain kinetic energy and vibrate faster and more strongly.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps sorry po kung may nakita kayung mali</p><br />
