Many sectors are reluctant with the new modalities in learning introduced by the Department of Education. They claimed that, although, education is necessary but many things should be given great consideration and one of which is the availability of internet connectivity in every homes. Just as books are readily available at a normal school setting, internet connectivity should be warranted as well. Moreover, parents had also expressed their fear that this mode of learning might affect their work since they need to supervise the learning of their children at home unlike before; otherwise, children will not learn a great deal. Some parents still prefer the previous way of conducting classes in spite of the danger it will bring. On the other hand, the Department of Education assured the public that they have alternative modes of learning delivery aside from the use of video lessons for remote or distance learning. Also, they guaranteed that the education sector is hands on in providing worthwhile learning in the new normal despite the challenges. They affirmed that the new mode of learning will not compromise quality in the same way that they were able to maintain it. They also appeal to the public to avoid spreading fake news instead be a channel of positivity for others.

On the other hand, this has served as a challenge for teacher and students who are experiencing digital divide. Whatever your modality is, I believ you fully understand the highs and lows of ubiquitous learning by now, and whatev may happen in the future, I believe that we are much more prepared to face it becau of what we have faced now. Do I get a thumbs up or a thumbs down? Could you share with me your person thoughts about learning MIL in the New Normal?

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

This study examined the relationship of book and e-book, this paper tends to identify in 1 affects reading comprehension. Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</a>

ACCOUNTING SKILLS By Susan Jacobs I brought with me today some good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you were to open a CPA practice today, you could earn one thousand pesos an hour for your services. The bad news is that you would have to share that with each of your employees. If your business were successful and you had several clients that hourly fee could accumulate to quite a salary, even after deducting your employees' wages. I plan to be a CPA when I graduate from college. I have been working for five years on that degree and I feel that I know some of the skills and abilities that are needed to be a successful CPA. To be a successful accountant, you'll need some skills. I am going to tell you about some of those skills so that you can make sure you possess them when you're ready to start your career These skills are: (1) the ability to communicate, (2) the ability to use your knowledge, and (3) the ability to use computers. 	The most important skill we can possess as accountants is the ability to communicate on an interpersonal level. In a public practice, we will be dealing with clients of all kinds. In my interview with Keith Morrison, a CPA, I learned that our ability to communicate will determine our success or failure in the business world. How well we meet the demands and handle the problems of our clients will decide our fate. 	The communication demands that we will face in business will include oral communication with clients and written communication with certain agencies. In dealing with clients, we will speak with individuals about their tax returns and company representatives about their books. We will also spend time writing to various agencies, such as the Internal Revenue, the Tax Commission, regulatory agencies, and insurance agencies. According to Mr Morrison, the whole objective of the accounting process is to communicate information to the end user. If we can't do that, we're not going to succeed in accounting. 	One of the problems Mr. Morrison runs into is when a client comes in with a problem, but the client isn't sure what the problem is, or she or he isn't quite sure how to explain it We as accountants have to understand the problem before we can help the client. We must be good listeners so that we know which questions to ask By asking the right question, we can figure out the problem. We can waste a lot of time by failing to communicate effectively. The second most important skill is the ability to use the knowledge we have acquired while pursuing our accounting degrees. Mr. Morrison believes that we'll have the knowledge that we need from the courses we are required to take, but whether we can apply that knowledge will depend on our attitude. We must get training and experience in order to apply our knowledge and get the best results. The third most important skill we must have is the ability to use computers in our accounting capacity. A mere familiarity will not be enough. We must be able to deal with computers, function with them, be able to communicate with them in a sense, and be able to get along with them. Programming skills aren't essential, but they would be helpful. They would enable us to be more familiar with the computer. We must feel comfortable with computers and not be afraid of them. We must be able to combine our accounting knowledge with our computer knowledge to master the business application. In conclusion, there is more to being a successful accountant than obtaining a degree. We must be able to communicate with our clients on an interpersonal level. We must be able to get to the root of their problems, and we must be able to communicate to them the information they need whether orally or in writing. We must be able to apply the knowledge we've acquired while pursuing our degrees in order to get the best results from the training and experience we pick up along the way And we must have an understanding of computers and how they function in the business world so that we can combine our accounting with the computer and master the business applications. We must all want to be successful in our careers. We must sharpen our skills and make the most of our knowledge, and we will succeed.ilalagay kopo s taas yung pic ayun po yun dun sasagutan thank you po​</a>

The important thing in education is the development of the human mind. Education is meant to enable the mind to create and produce new formula, new inventions and new tools. True education  makes the mind look for solutions to new problems whose solutions perhaps are not in the books. It is meant to develop individuals who can produce advanced and new knowledge, who can follow new ways of thinking and introduce new thoughts of their own, who can read on for themselves and learn alone when they are no longer in the school university, and whose mind does not stop thinking when it is faced with new challenges. Such individuals will be the products of true institutions of learnings, they are the real wealth of the nation. -Source: http://study.com/academy/lesson General Statementsplease help me​</a>

9. Write about a challenge you're facing right now-

10. What period of school (elementary school, middle
school, high school, or college) do you feel is most
important? Why?m</h2><br />
                        <p>1. This is a complex issue that depends on the circumstances surrounding the adoption and the reasons for giving up the pet. In general, it is important for pet owners to take responsibility for their pets and provide them with a safe and loving home. However, there may be situations where giving up a pet is the best option for both the pet and the owner. For example, if the owner is no longer able to care for the pet due to financial or health reasons, it may be better for the pet to be rehomed with someone who can provide for their needs. Ultimately, it is important for pet owners to carefully consider their decision to adopt a pet and to make a commitment to providing for their needs throughout their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>3. There are many reasons why people may begin smoking and drinking alcohol, including social pressure, stress, boredom, and addiction. Some people may start smoking or drinking as a way to fit in with a particular group or to cope with difficult emotions or situations. Others may be influenced by advertising or media messages that promote smoking or drinking as a way to have fun or relax. Additionally, some people may have a genetic predisposition to addiction, which can make it more difficult for them to quit once they start.</p><p></p><p>4. No, video games are not always bad for kids. While excessive screen time can have negative effects on children's physical and mental health, playing video games in moderation can have positive benefits. Video games can improve cognitive skills, such as problem-solving, spatial awareness, and decision-making. They can also provide a sense of accomplishment and social connection for children who may struggle with these areas in real life. However, it is important for parents to monitor their children's video game use and to ensure that they are playing age-appropriate games that are not overly violent or addictive.</p><p></p><p></p><p>6. Yes, parrots are capable of mimicking human speech and other sounds. They have a unique vocal structure that allows them to imitate sounds they hear in their environment. However, not all parrots will learn to speak, and some may only learn a few words or phrases. Additionally, parrots may not always understand the meaning of the words they are saying, and may simply repeat them as a form of mimicry.</p><p></p><p>7. My parents don't understand the unique challenges and pressures that I face as a student in today's educational system. They may not realize the amount of homework and studying required for me to succeed, or the stress I feel when preparing for exams or completing projects. Additionally, they may not be aware of the social and emotional challenges I face, such as peer pressure and anxiety. It's important for us to communicate openly and work together to find solutions to these challenges.</p><p></p><p>8.  No, a dog is not always at fault when it bites a person. Dogs may bite for a variety of reasons, including fear, aggression, or pain. In some cases, the person who was bitten may have provoked the dog or entered the dog's territory without permission. However, it is the responsibility of the dog owner to train and socialize their dog to prevent bites from occurring. If a dog does bite someone, it is important to seek medical attention and report the incident to local authorities.</p><p></p><p>9. As a student, I am facing the challenge of transitioning to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It's difficult to stay motivated and focused while studying from home, and I miss the face-to-face interaction with my teachers and classmates. </p><p></p><p>One thing I am doing is creating a designated study space at home, free from distractions and other obligations. This helps me stay focused and motivated while studying. Additionally, I am taking advantage of online resources such as study groups, online tutoring, and virtual office hours with teachers to get the support I need. I set aside specific times each day for studying, exercise, and socializing with friends and family.</p><p>By prioritizing my mental and emotional well-being, I can better cope with the challenges of online learning and maintain a positive outlook on my academic and personal goals.</p><p></p><p>10. It is widely recognized that each period of school is important in its own way. As a student, I acknowledge that elementary school lays the foundation for learning and establishes essential skills such as reading, writing, and basic math. During middle school, I was exposed to a wider range of subjects and began to develop my interests and passions. High school is a crucial time for my academic and personal development, as I prepare for college or the workforce and begin to take on more responsibility. In college, I will have opportunities for further academic and personal growth, and will be prepared for my future career. Overall, each period of school is important and contributes to my overall education and growth.</p><br />

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</h2><br />

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

                            18. Activity 5. If you have successfully answered the above exercises, then you are ready for a more challenging one. ACCOUNTING SKILLS By Susan Jacobs I brought with me today some good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you were to open a CPA practice today, you could earn one thousand pesos an hour for your services. The bad news is that you would have to share that with each of your employees. If your business were successful and you had several clients that hourly fee could accumulate to quite a salary, even after deducting your employees' wages. I plan to be a CPA when I graduate from college. I have been working for five years on that degree and I feel that I know some of the skills and abilities that are needed to be a successful CPA. To be a successful accountant, you'll need some skills. I am going to tell you about some of those skills so that you can make sure you possess them when you're ready to start your career These skills are: (1) the ability to communicate, (2) the ability to use your knowledge, and (3) the ability to use computers. 	The most important skill we can possess as accountants is the ability to communicate on an interpersonal level. In a public practice, we will be dealing with clients of all kinds. In my interview with Keith Morrison, a CPA, I learned that our ability to communicate will determine our success or failure in the business world. How well we meet the demands and handle the problems of our clients will decide our fate. 	The communication demands that we will face in business will include oral communication with clients and written communication with certain agencies. In dealing with clients, we will speak with individuals about their tax returns and company representatives about their books. We will also spend time writing to various agencies, such as the Internal Revenue, the Tax Commission, regulatory agencies, and insurance agencies. According to Mr Morrison, the whole objective of the accounting process is to communicate information to the end user. If we can't do that, we're not going to succeed in accounting. 	One of the problems Mr. Morrison runs into is when a client comes in with a problem, but the client isn't sure what the problem is, or she or he isn't quite sure how to explain it We as accountants have to understand the problem before we can help the client. We must be good listeners so that we know which questions to ask By asking the right question, we can figure out the problem. We can waste a lot of time by failing to communicate effectively. The second most important skill is the ability to use the knowledge we have acquired while pursuing our accounting degrees. Mr. Morrison believes that we'll have the knowledge that we need from the courses we are required to take, but whether we can apply that knowledge will depend on our attitude. We must get training and experience in order to apply our knowledge and get the best results. The third most important skill we must have is the ability to use computers in our accounting capacity. A mere familiarity will not be enough. We must be able to deal with computers, function with them, be able to communicate with them in a sense, and be able to get along with them. Programming skills aren't essential, but they would be helpful. They would enable us to be more familiar with the computer. We must feel comfortable with computers and not be afraid of them. We must be able to combine our accounting knowledge with our computer knowledge to master the business application. In conclusion, there is more to being a successful accountant than obtaining a degree. We must be able to communicate with our clients on an interpersonal level. We must be able to get to the root of their problems, and we must be able to communicate to them the information they need whether orally or in writing. We must be able to apply the knowledge we've acquired while pursuing our degrees in order to get the best results from the training and experience we pick up along the way And we must have an understanding of computers and how they function in the business world so that we can combine our accounting with the computer and master the business applications. We must all want to be successful in our careers. We must sharpen our skills and make the most of our knowledge, and we will succeed.ilalagay kopo s taas yung pic ayun po yun dun sasagutan thank you po​</h2><br />

Many sectors are reluctant with the new modalities in learning introduced by the Department of Education. They claimed that, although, education is necessary but many things should be given great consideration and one of which is the availability of internet connectivity in every homes. Just as books are readily available at a normal school setting, internet connectivity should be warranted as well. Moreover, parents had also expressed their fear that this mode of learning might affect their work since they need to supervise the learning of their children at home unlike before; otherwise, children will not learn a great deal. Some parents still prefer the previous way of conducting classes in spite of the danger it will bring. On the other hand, the Department of Education assured the public that they have alternative modes of learning delivery aside from the use of video lessons for remote or distance learning. Also, they guaranteed that the education sector is hands on in providing worthwhile learning in the new normal despite the challenges. They affirmed that the new mode of learning will not compromise quality in the same way that they were able to maintain it. They also appeal to the public to avoid spreading fake news instead be a channel of positivity for others. Face to face Learning New mode of Learning​</h2><br />

It is meant to develop individuals who can produce advanced and new knowledge, who can follow new ways of thinking and introduce new thoughts of their own, who can read on for themselves and learn alone when they are no longer in the school university, and whose mind does not stop thinking when it is faced with new challenges. Such individuals will be the products of true institutions of learnings, they are the real wealth of the nation. -Source: http://study.com/academy/lesson General Statementsplease help me​</h2><br />
