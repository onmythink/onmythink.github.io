                                            Why resilience matters a lot in Disaster Preparedness (excerpt)  
Resilience has become a “hot word” recently to describe the ability of the Filipinos to immediately bounce back from hardships and devastating events, move on and rebuild easily. Others tagged “Filipino resiliency” as a romanticized trait that has been used to excuse the government’s shortcomings in handling and preparing for natural hazards.
However, from the perspective of disaster preparedness, resilience can be the people’s strongest trait. “Being resilient doesn’t mean ignoring the roots of vulnerabilities. It is the goal of resilience to improve disaster mitigation.” says Academician Alfredo Mahar Lagmay, NRCP Member of the NRCP Earth and Space Sciences Division, and Professor at the UP National Institute of Geological Studies. With the onslaught of the COVID pandemic and threats of climate change, communities will have to adapt even more to stressful environmental conditions, and investing on resilience is a foremost important measure. Lagmay pointed out that the government should focus on enhancing the resilience of its communities for better disaster planning and hazard management which would allow reducing the disaster impacts and losses. 
Resilience is defined as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events. Disaster resilience is determined by the degree to which individuals, communities and public and private organizations are capable of organizing themselves to learn from past disasters and reduce their risks to future ones.
“Better anticipation of hazards and disasters could lead to better planning and enhanced resilience,” added Lagmay.

Write the results of your critical evaluation on the spaces provided. ABSTRACT The crucial role of language in the improvement of man’s critical thinking in this era of globalization, multiculturalism, knowledge explosion, or modern technology prodded several professionals, academicians, and graduate -school students to conduct research studies on language teaching and learning specifically, on language theories and pedagogical practices related to communicative approach and functional grammar. (Freeman &amp;Anderson, 2012).One modern grammar theory this study assumed as the theoretical underpinning of any language teaching and learning methodology that zeroes in on critical thinking, a higher -order thinking strategy that every nation in this contemporary world needs to progress economically and politically, is the SFG or System Functional Grammar. The results showed that the ideas behind the Systematic Functional Grammar were likewise the ones applied in language teaching and learning activities infusing critical thinking. The SFG concepts : (1) multi-functionality of clauses, (2) grammar structures linked with communicative functions, (3) interactive activities, (4) contextualized exercises, (5) stressed macro-function of language, (6) exercises giving wide latitude of choice and, (7) use of discourse as the dominant language structure would trigger off critical -thinking acts like: comparing, classifying, patterning, planning, critiquing, hypothesizing, and reasoning inductively or deductively. (Bloor 1995; Eggins 1994; Halliday 1994, 2004, 2009) Validating the impact of the SFG theory on developing excellent communicators and reasonable or logical thinkers for global progress is the contribution of this paper to the field of language teaching and learning.

                            4. Why resilience matters a lot in Disaster Preparedness (excerpt)  
Resilience has become a “hot word” recently to describe the ability of the Filipinos to immediately bounce back from hardships and devastating events, move on and rebuild easily. Others tagged “Filipino resiliency” as a romanticized trait that has been used to excuse the government’s shortcomings in handling and preparing for natural hazards.
However, from the perspective of disaster preparedness, resilience can be the people’s strongest trait. “Being resilient doesn’t mean ignoring the roots of vulnerabilities. It is the goal of resilience to improve disaster mitigation.” says Academician Alfredo Mahar Lagmay, NRCP Member of the NRCP Earth and Space Sciences Division, and Professor at the UP National Institute of Geological Studies. With the onslaught of the COVID pandemic and threats of climate change, communities will have to adapt even more to stressful environmental conditions, and investing on resilience is a foremost important measure. Lagmay pointed out that the government should focus on enhancing the resilience of its communities for better disaster planning and hazard management which would allow reducing the disaster impacts and losses. 
Resilience is defined as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events. Disaster resilience is determined by the degree to which individuals, communities and public and private organizations are capable of organizing themselves to learn from past disasters and reduce their risks to future ones.
“Better anticipation of hazards and disasters could lead to better planning and enhanced resilience,” added Lagmay.

Write the results of your critical evaluation on the spaces provided. ABSTRACT The crucial role of language in the improvement of man’s critical thinking in this era of globalization, multiculturalism, knowledge explosion, or modern technology prodded several professionals, academicians, and graduate -school students to conduct research studies on language teaching and learning specifically, on language theories and pedagogical practices related to communicative approach and functional grammar. (Freeman &amp;Anderson, 2012).One modern grammar theory this study assumed as the theoretical underpinning of any language teaching and learning methodology that zeroes in on critical thinking, a higher -order thinking strategy that every nation in this contemporary world needs to progress economically and politically, is the SFG or System Functional Grammar. The results showed that the ideas behind the Systematic Functional Grammar were likewise the ones applied in language teaching and learning activities infusing critical thinking. The SFG concepts : (1) multi-functionality of clauses, (2) grammar structures linked with communicative functions, (3) interactive activities, (4) contextualized exercises, (5) stressed macro-function of language, (6) exercises giving wide latitude of choice and, (7) use of discourse as the dominant language structure would trigger off critical -thinking acts like: comparing, classifying, patterning, planning, critiquing, hypothesizing, and reasoning inductively or deductively. (Bloor 1995; Eggins 1994; Halliday 1994, 2004, 2009) Validating the impact of the SFG theory on developing excellent communicators and reasonable or logical thinkers for global progress is the contribution of this paper to the field of language teaching and learning. Evaluation:​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The abstract of this research paper appears to be in keeping with the concepts of abstract writing in that it provides a clear overview of the research study and its findings. It clearly states the purpose of the study, which is to investigate the role of language in improving critical thinking through the use of the Systematic Functional Grammar (SFG) theory. The abstract also includes a summary of the key findings, which is that the SFG concepts and language teaching and learning activities can trigger critical thinking skills such as comparing, classifying, patterning, and reasoning. Finally, the abstract specifies the contribution of the paper to the field of language teaching and learning, which is the validation of the impact of the SFG theory on developing excellent communicators and logical thinkers for global progress.</strong></p><br />
