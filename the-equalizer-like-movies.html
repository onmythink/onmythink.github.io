                                            The laws of motions always remind us that we should be careful in everything that we do because for every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction. If we do good things to others, they will also do good things, not everyone but someone will. Just like what Mr. Klaus said in the movie Klaus, "a simple act of kindness always sparks another".Make a reflection and write it on the answer sheet.​</a>

If we do good things to others, they will also do good things, not everyone but someone will.

                        <p>It is an unplanned act whose goal is to bring kindness and spread kindness to those we know and those we do not know. It’s a practice that offers hope to unsuspecting people to provide a ray of light in someone’s life. It brings a smile to a frown; it can create a positive emotion when none was expected; it can be the beginning of a new start; and it has the capability to change how we treat one another</p><br />
