What lesson the poem is teaching us?nswer any two of the following questionsThe Little Black BoyBY WILLIAM BLAKEMy mother bore me in the southern wild,And I am black, but O! my soul is white;White as an angel is the English child: But I am black as if bereav'd of light.My mother taught me underneath a tree And sitting down before the heat of day,She took me on her lap and kissed me,And pointing to the east began to say. Look on the rising sun: there God does live And gives his light, and gives his heat away. And flowers and trees and beasts and men receiveComfort in morning joy in the noonday.And we are put on earth a little space,That we may learn to bear the beams of love, And these black bodies and this sun-burnt faceIs but a cloud, and like a shady grove.For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice. Saying: come out from the grove my love &amp; care,And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.Thus did my mother say and kissed me, And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free,And round the tent of God like lambs we joy: Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear, To lean in joy upon our fathers knee. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,And be like him and he will then love me.​</a>

Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells.Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple winds,Rains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients, for love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness.My duty and destiny are thirty-three million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconuts, throwing nets far into the Pacific.Hacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese, and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of ManFor I am Christian who looks upon all men and womenAs brothers and sisters whose task is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst any injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.Guide Questions:1.

Are you both proud for the same reasons?I Am Proud to be A FilipinoToribia A. ManoI am a Filipino. I came from islands rippled with sunWhere days are green fires and nights are warmWith moon and stars. Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells,Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple windsRains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients for my love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness,My duty and destiny are thirty-million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconut, throwing nets far into the PacificHacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving, restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of manFor I am a Christian who looks upon all menAs brothers whose task it is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.I believe in my people as noble keepers of the faith:That all men are equal; that all men are free.I believe with verdant and sprawling mountains, hills, valleys, plains,Lakes, waterfalls, rivers, sunsets, beachesAnd a generous sea. Alive, sovereign, wondrously happy in work andAbundant with hope for my people.I am proud to be a Filipino.Learning Task 1:After reading the poem, answer the following questions.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>BIO-POEM ABOUT NATURE
</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
I am a bird in the sky. I am able to fly as high as my limit and go to any place I wish to. I give additional beauty to the gift of nature we all live in. But the beauty I loved to go back and forth before is starting to grow old as I do. And it makes me sad. Could you take care of these places for me please?
</p><p>
</p><p>Although I'd like to think that this is a poem and also I believe its purpose was to serve as an eye opener on what's happening with our nature these days. I tried to incorporate the elements of poem as much as possible. In this case, I think this will be a freestyle one and I’d like to give emphasis on how I chose a bird as the subject of the poem.
</p><p>
</p><p>For me, <strong>the bird symbolizes an old person who has seen the beauty of this world - untouched.</strong> And on his verge of death or as his journey comes to an end, he witnessed the drastic changes of how bad our world turned out to be and he expresses his regret that not all of us will be able to see the beauty he saw.

Look on the rising sun: there God does live And gives his light, and gives his heat away. And flowers and trees and beasts and men receiveComfort in morning joy in the noonday.And we are put on earth a little space,That we may learn to bear the beams of love, And these black bodies and this sun-burnt faceIs but a cloud, and like a shady grove.For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice. Saying: come out from the grove my love &amp; care,And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.Thus did my mother say and kissed me, And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free,And round the tent of God like lambs we joy: Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear, To lean in joy upon our fathers knee. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,And be like him and he will then love me.​</h2><br />

ManoI am a Filipino. I came from islands rippled with sunWhere days are green fires and nights are warmWith moon and stars. Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells,Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple windsRains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients for my love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness,My duty and destiny are thirty-million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconut, throwing nets far into the PacificHacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving, restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of manFor I am a Christian who looks upon all menAs brothers whose task it is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.I believe in my people as noble keepers of the faith:That all men are equal; that all men are free.I believe with verdant and sprawling mountains, hills, valleys, plains,Lakes, waterfalls, rivers, sunsets, beachesAnd a generous sea. Alive, sovereign, wondrously happy in work andAbundant with hope for my people.I am proud to be a Filipino.Learning Task 1:After reading the poem, answer the following questions.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Islands are described in the poem as "rippled with sun, where days are green fires and with warm nights"It is true that these were done by many Filipinos in the past and there are until now, I agree, but we Filipinos have also improved and there are a lot of us now who are professionals in almost every work aspect.It is said in the poem that the cure for the ills of man is "grandeur of charity and peace". And yes, I agree with us helping one another and spreading peace all throughout, evil will surely subside.Yes, it is a responsibility, to walk chin up, full of confidence and to proudly say "I am a Filipino", when asked of race, to say that "I am dark-skinned, hardworking, and a <strong>FILIPI</strong><strong>NO</strong>, and I will always be proud of it", to show our appreciation and undying respect of our culture,country,and people.All of it still lives, except the fact that the number of people who willingly show these traits have decreased.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>These answers contain my opinions, so feel free to change them...</p><p></p><p>Please do not that I am not a genius and that my answers are not 100% accurate...</p><p></p><p>#Goodluck!</p><p>#Carryonlearning</p><br />
