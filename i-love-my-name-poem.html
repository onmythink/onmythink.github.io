                    <p>How Do I Love Thee? By: Elizabeth Barret Browning How Do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of every day&#039;s Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for right. I love thee purely, as they tum from praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood&#039;s faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death. 1.How would the poem be different if the opening line was &quot;Why do I love thee?&quot; (5points) 2.How many ways of loving does the speaker identify? Do these ways of loving overlap, conflict, or complement one another? Explain. (10points) 3.Why do you think &quot;How do I love thee?&quot; is such a popular love poem? What features of the sonnet might make it more accessible or universal than other love poetry? (10points) 4.How would the poem affect readers differently if the beloved was referred to as &quot;you&quot; instead of as &quot;thee&quot;? What if the beloved was given a first name - Romeo, Robert, etc.? (10points)​</p>

                                            The Gift by Rabindranath Tagore ￼ Next    O my love, what gift of mine Shall I give you this dawn? A morning song? But morning does not last long— The heat of the sun Wilts like a flower And songs that tire Are done. O friend, when you come to my gate. At dusk What is it you ask? What shall I bring you? A light? A lamp from a secret corner of my silent house? But will you want to take it with you Down the crowded street? Alas, The wind will blow it out. Whatever gifts are in my power to give you, Be they flowers, Be they gems for your neck How can they please you If in time they must surely wither, Crack, Lose lustre? All that my hands can place in yours Will slip through your fingers And fall forgotten to the dust To turn into dust. Rather, When you have leisure, Wander idly through my garden in spring And let an unknown, hidden flower’s scent startle you Into sudden wondering— Let that displaced moment Be my gift. Or if, as you peer your way down a shady avenue, Suddenly, spilled From the thick gathered tresses of evening A single shivering fleck of sunset-light stops you, Turns your daydreams to gold, Let that light be an innocent Gift. Truest treasure is fleeting; It sparkles for a moment, then goes. It does not tell its name; its tune Stops us in our tracks, its dance disappears At the toss of an anklet I know no way to it— No hand, nor word can reach it. Friend, whatever you take of it, On your own, Without asking, without knowing, let that Be yours. Anything I can give you is trifling— Be it a flower, or a song. 1.What gifts are in the speaker’s power to give a loved one? 2.Why is the speaker not giving any of these gifts? 3.What gifts does the speaker consider more precious? Why? 4.What do the “scent of the flower” and fleck sunset-light” symbolize? 5.What message does the poem convey in the last two lines? 6. Read the poem and write an analysis paper after. ​</a>

Mad Girl's Love Song by Sylvia Plath God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade: Exit seraphim and Satan's men: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. The stars go waltzing out in blue and red, And arbitrary blackness gallops in: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. I fancied you'd return the way you said, But I grow old and I forget your name. (I think I made you up inside my head.) I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. (I think I made you up inside my head.) I should have loved a thunderbird instead; At least when spring comes they roar back again. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. (I think I made you up inside my head.)"

They met when the time came; it was a decree of fate,
The free bird cried, "Oh my love let us fly to the worlds,"
The caged bird whispered, "Come here! Let us both live in the cage,"

The cage bird said, "Sit by my side; I'll teach you the speech of the learned"
The free bird cried, "No oh no! Songs can never be taught!"
The cage bird said, "Alas for me!" I know not the songs of the woodlands!"
Their love was intense with longing, but they never could fly wing to
wing, through the bars, of the cage they looked and vain was their wish to
know each other, they fluttered their wings in yearning and sang. "Come
Closer My Love!"
The free bird cried, "It cannot be, I feel the closed doors of the cage!"
The caged bird whispered, "Alas, my wings are powerless and dead!"

                            1. How Do I Love Thee? By: Elizabeth Barret Browning How Do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of every day's Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for right. I love thee purely, as they tum from praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death. 1.How would the poem be different if the opening line was "Why do I love thee?" (5points) 2.How many ways of loving does the speaker identify? Do these ways of loving overlap, conflict, or complement one another? Explain. (10points) 3.Why do you think "How do I love thee?" is such a popular love poem? What features of the sonnet might make it more accessible or universal than other love poetry? (10points) 4.How would the poem affect readers differently if the beloved was referred to as "you" instead of as "thee"? What if the beloved was given a first name - Romeo, Robert, etc.? (10points)​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. If the opening line was "Why do I love thee?", the poem would likely focus more on the reasons or causes for the speaker's love, rather than the ways in which they love the beloved. The poem would change the focus from the speaker's expression of love to the speaker's contemplation of the love they feel.</p><p></p><p>2. The speaker identifies multiple ways of loving in the poem. They love the beloved "to the depth and breadth and height" of their soul, "to the level of every day's most quiet need", "freely" and "purely", and "with the passion put to use in [their] old griefs" and "with [their] childhood's faith". These ways of loving overlap, complement and do not conflict with each other, as the speaker expresses the different aspects of their love for the beloved.</p><p></p><p>3. "How do I love thee?" is such a popular love poem because it expresses the depth and complexity of love in an eloquent and emotional way. It is a sonnet, which is a traditional and well-respected form of poetry, and the language is beautiful and poetic. The poem is also relatable as it expresses the different ways in which one can love another person.</p><p></p><p>4. If the beloved was referred to as "you" instead of as "thee", the poem would likely be less formal and more familiar, and it might come across as more personal and intimate. If the beloved was given a first name, it would give the poem more of a personal touch and readers might relate the poem to someone they know and the love they feel for them</p><p></p><br />

                            6. The Gift by Rabindranath Tagore ￼ Next    O my love, what gift of mine Shall I give you this dawn? A morning song? But morning does not last long— The heat of the sun Wilts like a flower And songs that tire Are done. O friend, when you come to my gate. At dusk What is it you ask? What shall I bring you? A light? A lamp from a secret corner of my silent house? But will you want to take it with you Down the crowded street? Alas, The wind will blow it out. Whatever gifts are in my power to give you, Be they flowers, Be they gems for your neck How can they please you If in time they must surely wither, Crack, Lose lustre? All that my hands can place in yours Will slip through your fingers And fall forgotten to the dust To turn into dust. Rather, When you have leisure, Wander idly through my garden in spring And let an unknown, hidden flower’s scent startle you Into sudden wondering— Let that displaced moment Be my gift. Or if, as you peer your way down a shady avenue, Suddenly, spilled From the thick gathered tresses of evening A single shivering fleck of sunset-light stops you, Turns your daydreams to gold, Let that light be an innocent Gift. Truest treasure is fleeting; It sparkles for a moment, then goes. It does not tell its name; its tune Stops us in our tracks, its dance disappears At the toss of an anklet I know no way to it— No hand, nor word can reach it. Friend, whatever you take of it, On your own, Without asking, without knowing, let that Be yours. Anything I can give you is trifling— Be it a flower, or a song. 1.What gifts are in the speaker’s power to give a loved one? 2.Why is the speaker not giving any of these gifts? 3.What gifts does the speaker consider more precious? Why? 4.What do the “scent of the flower” and fleck sunset-light” symbolize? 5.What message does the poem convey in the last two lines? 6. Read the poem and write an analysis paper after. ​</h2><br />

The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest,
They met when the time came; it was a decree of fate,
The free bird cried, "Oh my love let us fly to the worlds,"
The caged bird whispered, "Come here! Let us both live in the cage,"
Said the free birds, "Among bars, where is the room to spread one's

The free bird cried, "My darling, sing the song of the woodlands."
The cage bird said, "Sit by my side; I'll teach you the speech of the learned"
The free bird cried, "No oh no! Songs can never be taught!"
The cage bird said, "Alas for me!" I know not the songs of the woodlands!"
Their love was intense with longing, but they never could fly wing to
wing, through the bars, of the cage they looked and vain was their wish to
know each other, they fluttered their wings in yearning and sang. "Come
Closer My Love!"
The free bird cried, "It cannot be, I feel the closed doors of the cage!"
The caged bird whispered, "Alas, my wings are powerless and dead!"

The little green fruit is packed with vitamins and minerals which are good for one’s health. Avocados are also rich in fiber which is good for removing toxins in our large intestines.

I believe they do not have any other good thing to do so they just read. I also find readers as boring people. a. NOT BIASb. BIAS6. When it comes to work, the Generation X (people who are 40 years and above) are the best. They are all hardworking, serious, and dedicated to their jobs. They also have a lot of experience already. They make the best teachers, supervisors, office workers, and managers. a. BIASb. NOT BIAS7. The young generation is really the worst! They sleep late at night and wake up very late.

                            14. Annabel LeeBY EDGAR ALLAN POEIt was many and many a year ago,In a kingdom by the sea,That a maiden there lived whom you may knowBy the name of Annabel Lee;And this maiden she lived with no other thoughtThan to love and be loved by me.I was a child and she was a child,In this kingdom by the sea,But we loved with a love that was more than love—I and my Annabel Lee—With a love that the wingèd seraphs of HeavenCoveted her and me.And this was the reason that, long ago,In this kingdom by the sea,A wind blew out of a cloud, chillingNor the demons down under the seaCan ever dissever my soul from the soulOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreamsOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;My beautiful Annabel Lee;So that her highborn kinsmen cameAnd bore her away from me,To shut her up in a sepulchreIn this kingdom by the sea.The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,Went envying her and me—Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,In this kingdom by the sea)That the wind came out of the cloud by night,Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.But our love it was stronger by far than the loveOf those who were older than we—Of many far wiser than we—And neither the angels in Heaven aboveAnd the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyesOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the sideOf my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,In her sepulchre there by the sea—In her tomb by the sounding sea.1.

                            16. When I say, “I am a Christian”I’m not shouting, “I’ve been saved!”I’m whispering, “I get lost sometimesThat’s why I chose this way”When I say, “I am a Christian”I don’t speak with human prideI’m confessing that I stumble –needing God to be my guideWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I’m not trying to be strongI’m professing that I’m weakand pray for strength to carry onWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I’m not bragging of successI’m admitting that I’ve failedand cannot ever pay the debtWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I don’t think I know it allI submit to my confusionasking humbly to be taughtWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I’m not claiming to be perfectMy flaws are far too visiblebut God believes I’m worth itWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I still feel the sting of painI have my share of heartachewhich is why I seek God’s nameWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I do not wish to judgeI have no authorityI only know I’m lovedQuestions:1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Being a Christian does not equate to perfection. </p><p></p><p>2. It means that to be a "true" Christian, we have to accept our shortcomings, weaknesses and faults, because only God is perfect, and we should seek him for forgiveness of our sins and to give light to all our confusion. </p><p></p><p>3.My idea fits perfectly the meaning of this poem, so I agree with it.
