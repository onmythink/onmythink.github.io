                                            What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.

                            6. What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.
