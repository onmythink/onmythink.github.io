Quezon’s daughter, into the Quezon museum on Elliptical Road, Quezon City. The “Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon” at Quezon Memorial Shrine was inaugurated Wednesday in time for the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 to 1944.

Quezon has been finally recognized for his “open door” policy during the Commonwealth period, which allowed the entry into the country of more than 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of Nazism under then German leader Adolf Hitler.During simple rites at Quezon Memorial Circle, the Philippine leader was awarded Wednesday the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation (RWF) Medal for his “life-saving plan” and for “reaching out to the victims of the Nazi murderous machine.”Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who saved an undisclosed number of Jews and persecuted people in Hungary during the Holocaust. His death while under Soviet captivity has been the subject of controversy.Internet connection problem cuts off Palace briefing on telco servicesThe medal was handed to Ma. Zenaida “Nini” Quezon Avanceña, daughter of Quezon, by Effie Ben-Matityau, Israel’s ambassador to the Philippines, and Lee Blumenthal, board member of the Jewish Association of the Philippines.President Aquino and other government officials attended the ceremony at the newly renovated Quezon Museum, which was formerly the Quezon ancestral home in New Manila, Quezon City. It was transported piece by piece to Quezon Memorial Circle.Monumental projectIn a statement, the RWF said Quezon’s “original life-saving plans were more ambitious and far reaching.”“In fact, he wanted to absorb some 100,000 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. However, his monumental project was thwarted by the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion of the Philippines.”The group, which has offices in Jerusalem, Buenos Aires and New York, cited Quezon for epitomizing the “spirit of civic courage and solidarity exemplified by Raoul Wallenberg and all the men and women who reached out to the Nazi victims.”The RWF noted that “more than 300 heads of state, Nobel Prize laureates and distinguished personalities from all walks of life are honorary members of the foundation.”“One of the first to join its ranks was the then Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Mario Bergoglio, better known today as Pope Francis,” it added.The RWF event coincided with the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, described by Malacañang as “one of the many Filipinos who not only dedicated their careers to service but also led a life worthy of example.”“His accomplishments as a statesman include the ratification of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which led to Philippine self-government and eventual independence from the United States. Also among his legacies are his advocacy of women’s suffrage and the institutionalization of Filipino as our national language,” the Palace said.It added that Quezon’s “beliefs on the importance of moral and civic virtue are encapsulated in his Code of Citizenship and Ethics.”​</p>

                                            Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders. In 2020, the company invested R9.8 million in Learnerships and Bursaries. They also continue to provide supplementary Maths, Science and Technology tuition to approximately 1 800 under-privileged Grade 10 12 learners across South Africa through the Engen Maths and Science School programme.Questions1.2 Identify and explain TWO types of goals in line with Anelisa's story 1.3 Discuss any THREE challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles1.4 Analyse how Anelisa personal values contributed to his success1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</a>

Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

In a bowl, whisk Nestle cream until smooth. Add the condensed and evaporated milk. Whisk until well combined. Using a ladle, place a small amount of the milk mixture into the bottom of the dish, then place a layer of Graham crackers and top with the sliced mangoes. Ladle a mixture again, slowly pours over the crackers and the mangoes, making sure it covers all of the Graham crackers. Repeat by placing layers of crackers, mangoes, and milk mixture. Top off with Graham crumbs (or just crushed some Graham crackers). Cover and freeze overnight. Serve and enjoy!

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

Esplanada - @inquirerdotnetPhilippine Daily Inquirer / 03:42 AM August 20, 2015HAPPY 137TH, MLQ President Aquino gently leads Zenaida Quezon Avanceña, President Manuel L. Quezon’s daughter, into the Quezon museum on Elliptical Road, Quezon City. The “Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon” at Quezon Memorial Shrine was inaugurated Wednesday in time for the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 to 1944. PHOTO BY AURO MONTELLANO JR. AND GIL NARTEA/MALACAÑANG PHOTO BUREAUBetter late than never.The late President Manuel L. Quezon has been finally recognized for his “open door” policy during the Commonwealth period, which allowed the entry into the country of more than 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of Nazism under then German leader Adolf Hitler.During simple rites at Quezon Memorial Circle, the Philippine leader was awarded Wednesday the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation (RWF) Medal for his “life-saving plan” and for “reaching out to the victims of the Nazi murderous machine.”Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who saved an undisclosed number of Jews and persecuted people in Hungary during the Holocaust. His death while under Soviet captivity has been the subject of controversy.Internet connection problem cuts off Palace briefing on telco servicesThe medal was handed to Ma. Zenaida “Nini” Quezon Avanceña, daughter of Quezon, by Effie Ben-Matityau, Israel’s ambassador to the Philippines, and Lee Blumenthal, board member of the Jewish Association of the Philippines.President Aquino and other government officials attended the ceremony at the newly renovated Quezon Museum, which was formerly the Quezon ancestral home in New Manila, Quezon City. It was transported piece by piece to Quezon Memorial Circle.Monumental projectIn a statement, the RWF said Quezon’s “original life-saving plans were more ambitious and far reaching.”“In fact, he wanted to absorb some 100,000 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. However, his monumental project was thwarted by the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion of the Philippines.”The group, which has offices in Jerusalem, Buenos Aires and New York, cited Quezon for epitomizing the “spirit of civic courage and solidarity exemplified by Raoul Wallenberg and all the men and women who reached out to the Nazi victims.”The RWF noted that “more than 300 heads of state, Nobel Prize laureates and distinguished personalities from all walks of life are honorary members of the foundation.”“One of the first to join its ranks was the then Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Mario Bergoglio, better known today as Pope Francis,” it added.The RWF event coincided with the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, described by Malacañang as “one of the many Filipinos who not only dedicated their careers to service but also led a life worthy of example.”“His accomplishments as a statesman include the ratification of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which led to Philippine self-government and eventual independence from the United States. Also among his legacies are his advocacy of women’s suffrage and the institutionalization of Filipino as our national language,” the Palace said.It added that Quezon’s “beliefs on the importance of moral and civic virtue are encapsulated in his Code of Citizenship and Ethics.”​</h2><br />

                            2. Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders. In 2020, the company invested R9.8 million in Learnerships and Bursaries. They also continue to provide supplementary Maths, Science and Technology tuition to approximately 1 800 under-privileged Grade 10 12 learners across South Africa through the Engen Maths and Science School programme.Questions1.2 Identify and explain TWO types of goals in line with Anelisa's story 1.3 Discuss any THREE challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles1.4 Analyse how Anelisa personal values contributed to his success1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</h2><br />

This goal reflects his desire to make a positive impact on others and to contribute to making the world a better place.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.3 Three challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles are:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a) Childhood: Anelisa had a less than ideal childhood and had to bring himself up. This could have impacted his self-esteem and motivation.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>b) Lack of family support: Anelisa received very little support from his family who lived in the Eastern Cape. This could have impacted his financial stability and made it harder for him to achieve his goals.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>c) Limited financial resources: Anelisa's uncle was a taxi driver and worked irregular hours.

On the other hand, negative relationships can impede progress and discourage individuals from pursuing their goals.</strong></p><br />

                            4. 1. Junk Food is very harmful that is slowly eating away the health of the present generation. The term itself denotes how dangerous it is for our bodies. Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *
