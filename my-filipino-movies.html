Dear Diary,
January 4, 2019 we went to my mother’s friend’s house. They were visiting the Philippines again with their family. There were many cute children it looked like a nursery. I used to go there when I was younger and take care of the children. I hadn’t seen them in a while and they were still very nice people. </a>
