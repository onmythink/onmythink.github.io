The answer is:
False. Why? Because the Philippines nationals who desire to go to Hong Kong for transit, tourism or business with a stay of no more than 14 days do not need to apply for visas. So, not every country require visa.

                        As the human resource manager of Company XYZ, there are several sources you can explore to select management trainees for different departments. Here are some suggestions:<br /><br />Campus Recruitment: You can partner with universities and colleges to recruit fresh graduates who have completed their management courses. This can be a cost-effective way to find young talent with fresh ideas and a strong educational background.<br />Referrals: You can ask your current employees to refer qualified candidates they know who would be a good fit for the company. This can be a great way to find people who already have a connection to the company and may be a good cultural fit.<br />Job Portals: You can advertise the management trainee positions on popular job portals such as LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, Monster, and so on. This will allow you to reach a wider audience and attract candidates who are actively looking for job opportunities.<br />Industry Associations: You can reach out to industry associations that are related to the departments you're hiring for. They may have a pool of candidates who have already completed training and have experience in the industry.<br />Once you have a pool of potential candidates, you can use the following methods to select the best management trainees for your company:<br /><br />Aptitude Test: Conduct an aptitude test to measure the candidate's problem-solving skills, logical reasoning, and cognitive abilities. This will help you assess their potential to learn and perform well in the job.<br />Group Discussion: Conduct a group discussion to evaluate the candidate's communication skills, leadership potential, and team-working abilities. This will also give you an opportunity to observe their interpersonal skills and ability to persuade others.<br />Interview: Conduct one-on-one interviews to get to know the candidates better and understand their career aspirations, goals, and strengths. This will help you assess their fit with the company culture and the department they are applying for.<br />Assessment Center: Conduct an assessment center where candidates are given real-life scenarios and are evaluated on their ability to solve problems, lead a team, and make decisions. This can be a more comprehensive and objective way to assess a candidate's potential.<br />By using a combination of these selection methods, you can identify the most suitable management trainees who have the potential to contribute to the company's growth and success.<br />

                            17. in TVET Training, how to be assured that a trainee is already competent?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Objective
</p><p>In different sectors of industry and technical vocational institutes, centers and schools,
</p><p>due attention is given to the performance of the craftsmen / apprentices / trainees /
</p><p>students by applying both Competency Based Education and Training CBET as well as
</p><p>Competency Assurance Management System CAMS. The purpose of these systems is to
</p><p>provide guidelines to management to set valid and reliable controls in place with a view to
</p><p>have reasonable assurance of meeting their business objectives by assuring that their
</p><p>employees / apprentices / trainees / students are well trained, assessed, verified and
</p><p>proved to be competent at work location and that they can discharge their responsibilities
</p><p>in a safe and effective manner.
</p><p>The strategy of Competency Based TVET is based around "Occupational competencies"
</p><p>which are established for each career field and for each job title. A Competency Based
</p><p>TVET System generally uses combinations of powerful techniques to ensure that the
</p><p>needs of different Industry sectors are addressed (demand), courses or competency
</p><p>based training programmes are developed, competency based assessments / verifications
</p><p>are conducted, employees / apprentices / trainees / students are efficiently trained and
</p><p>competent. In this regards, techniques such as Management Information System MIS,
</p><p>Knowledge Management KM, Monitoring &amp; Evaluation M&amp;E and Competency Assurance
</p><p>Management System CAMS are generally used.
</p><p>2. Competency
</p><p>The Competency is defined as the individual’s ability to use, apply and demonstrate a
</p><p>group of related awareness, knowledge, skills and attitudes in order to perform tasks and
</p><p>duties successfully and which can be measured against well-accepted standards (levels)
</p><p>required in employment as well as assessed against provided evidences at work location.
</p><p>The competency affects both individual’s job responsibility and performance on the job
</p><p>and usually fall into two categories, namely technical and behavioral.
</p><p>The key aspects of the definition of competency are:
</p><p> Any job / occupation can be effectively and sufficiently described in terms of the
</p><p>Tasks that successful workers in that occupation perform.
</p><p> All Tasks have direct implications for the Awareness, Knowledge, Skills, and
</p><p>Attitudes Competencies that workers / trainees must acquire in order to perform
</p><p>the tasks correctly.
</p><p> Assessment is made on how the individual is actually performing work.
</p><p> An individual is incompetent no matter how much knowledge he has, as long as he
</p><p>can’t apply his knowledge and skills appropriately at work location.
</p><p> The assessment must be objective by conducting it against defined Competency
</p><p>Standards (Levels).
</p><p>The definition of competency implies a more formal, objective process of assessing
</p><p>performance by clearly knowing what is being assessed and how it is assessed. This  </p><p>approach is quite different than most of the past performance assessment practices
</p><p>utilized in the industry.
</p><p>3. Competence Based Occupational Standards
</p><p>One of the most important and significant developments in TVET, was the development of
</p><p>Competence Based Standards to support the design of training programmes and
</p><p>curricula.
</p><p>The move towards competence based standards started in the mid 1970s and represents
</p><p>a response to criticisms that education and training programmes were failing to meet the
</p><p>practical requirements of employment. In many occupational areas, employers found that
</p><p>newly qualified graduates of vocational training programmes were not capable of meeting
</p><p>the requirements of practice without substantial further education and training.
</p><p>The drive to develop competence based standards started in mainly manual and craft
</p><p>occupations where the practical requirements of employment were clear to see. Training
</p><p>in these occupational areas was dominated by traditional ‘school based’ approaches
</p><p>involving theoretical education combined with practical classes, often performed with out
</p><p>of date equipment and methods. The curriculum base of such programmes was clearly
</p><p>out of alignment with the rapidly changing needs of employment.
</p><p>The conception of competence based standards aimed to reverse the traditional
</p><p>educational model based on ‘inputs’ (the curriculum) and traditional educational practice
</p><p>which generally attempt to approach academic education. The traditional curriculum
</p><p>defined what the teacher should teach. The change in competence approach is the
</p><p>movement towards a definition of what the student needs to learn in order to perform to
</p><p>the standards required in employment.
</p><p>The instrument developed to enable this change is the concept of an occupational or
</p><p>educational ‘standard (level)’. The standard elaborates the level of competence required
</p><p>to perform successfully in an occupation and that description is used, in turn, to develop
</p><p>a closely aligned curriculum.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sociology also can help us prepare for specific careers, by studying particular sectors of society (which we discuss below), and by sharpening our skills needed to be effective in business and public life, such as analytic thinking and problem solving, information gathering and interpretation, and report writing.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Based on my research.</p><br />
                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="are-trainees-covered-with-insurance-how-%e2%80%8b">
                            30. Are trainees covered with insurance? How? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A trainee is paid during the training period. For example, a person who has studied in beauty school may start out as a trainee in a salon. After a few months of training, the person can then be offered the official role of a hairdresser. Training employees before officially giving them a permanent role is a way for employers to choose a skillful candidate for the job.</p><p></p><br />
