Researchers kept the spleen cells alive ina nutrient medium. They found that some cells produced a blood protein that showedpromise as a treatment for cancer and AIDS. The researchers patented the cells. Thepatient sued, claiming a share in profits from any products derived from his cells.The Legislative Committee ruled against the patient, stating that his suit "threatensto destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical research."
