John Knappert, one of those writers who published works about "The Myths and Legends of Indonesia," traced the flight of the Indonesians in Asia. He found out that the population of Indonesia was homogeneous. In addition, there were two hundred different languages in Indonesia but the existence of the hundred-odd languages is all related, with the exception of West Irian. The Indonesians were able to sail by using their invention which is known as proa Proa is a canoe that can survive the deep seas near Indonesia. They went to different directions: north to the Philippines and Formosa, where Indonesian language are still spoken; west to the East African coast; to Madagascar, where Malayo-Polynesian dialects are still spoken; east to Polynesia, where the languages of Hawaii, Eastem Island, Samoa, Fiji and Tahiti are clearly related to Malay and Javanese and finally south to New Zealand and the lush green islands of Indonesia. Since Indonesia is archipelagic, fishing is the main occupation of the people. Rice is the staple food. Indonesians hunted using sumpitan or blow-pipe. They mastered this, including the art of forging iron. If there were stories about spirits, it is primarily because the surrounding landscapes were full of spirits. The Hari which is the sun was identified as Wisnu, Bromo, the volcano was identified with Brahma, the Creator. Many islands were created by volcanic eruptions. The spirits of the waters were also diverse: the ocean- god brought rain, and the rich goddess live in the sawh (wet rice-fields) in the shape of a freshwater snake.Facts:1.2.3.Opinions:1.2.3.Need ko talaga ngayon mga lods​</a>

                                            Activity: Judge a Speech: Read the text to answer the given activities. Climate change is a change in climate patterns attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. Read and analyze the speech of former Secretary of Department of Natural Resources (DENR), Gina Lopez, about climate change at a conference in Marrakech, Morocco on November 17, 2016. After reading, answer the questions that follow. Do not forget to place your answers on your answer sheet. "Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life, some of which includes a snail - the venom of which has been found by a Nobel laureate to be better than morphine in addressing pain without the side effects. Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer, and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees, we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. We need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of 8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. So much to give. So much to lose. As the Secretary for the environment, I say we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. We will also plant bamboo - which is superb in carbon sequestration. But this bamboo can also build strong six story buildings, low-cost housing, floor tiles, textiles, clean our polluted waterways. In essence, adaptation, mitigation, inclusive economic growth does not have to be separate activities or choices. These objectives can all be achieved given the right approach. Because the Philippines is in the "firing line" of climate change. I propose that we be one venue for scientists as we explore ways for humanity to move forward. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message - it can be done, and we can do it! There is an integration of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non-negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future.Judging the Author's Reasoning: Answer the following questions.​</a>

                                            PLEASE ANSWER CORRECTLY :(((Read the following speech below. Then pick out the cohesive devices used in the statements.Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail. Our sponges and shells pre effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planet's history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. There's so much to give yet so much to lose. 7 As the Secretary for the environment, we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message it can be done, and we can do it! The rules of the Paris Agreement can state what the performance indicators of these models should be. There is an integratedness of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non- negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future. ​</a>

                            6. Activity: Judge a Speech: Read the text to answer the given activities. Climate change is a change in climate patterns attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. Read and analyze the speech of former Secretary of Department of Natural Resources (DENR), Gina Lopez, about climate change at a conference in Marrakech, Morocco on November 17, 2016. After reading, answer the questions that follow. Do not forget to place your answers on your answer sheet. "Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life, some of which includes a snail - the venom of which has been found by a Nobel laureate to be better than morphine in addressing pain without the side effects. Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer, and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees, we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. We need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of 8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. So much to give. So much to lose. As the Secretary for the environment, I say we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. We will also plant bamboo - which is superb in carbon sequestration. But this bamboo can also build strong six story buildings, low-cost housing, floor tiles, textiles, clean our polluted waterways. In essence, adaptation, mitigation, inclusive economic growth does not have to be separate activities or choices. These objectives can all be achieved given the right approach. Because the Philippines is in the "firing line" of climate change. I propose that we be one venue for scientists as we explore ways for humanity to move forward. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message - it can be done, and we can do it! There is an integration of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non-negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future.Judging the Author's Reasoning: Answer the following questions.​</h2><br />

                            11. PLEASE ANSWER CORRECTLY :(((Read the following speech below. Then pick out the cohesive devices used in the statements.Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail. Our sponges and shells pre effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planet's history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. There's so much to give yet so much to lose. 7 As the Secretary for the environment, we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message it can be done, and we can do it! The rules of the Paris Agreement can state what the performance indicators of these models should be. There is an integratedness of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non- negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future. ​</h2><br />
