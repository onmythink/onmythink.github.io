                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Lord heard her prayer and she bore a child whom she named Samuel. Once Samuel was weaned (about age three), she took him to the temple, saying, “I have granted him to Yahweh. As long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh” (1:28). She then prayed a prayer that would later serve as a model for Mary’s Magnificat (2:1-10; Luke 1:46-55).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Maybe that's right?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh: for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>God gave him another heart — He immediately fulfilled the last and chief of these signs: for Saul was no sooner gone from Samuel than he felt another spirit coming into him, a spirit of holiness, wisdom, and fortitude, to qualify him for the government of God’s people; which afterward God took from him because of his sins, 1 Samuel 16:14. See Psalm 51:12. He prophesied among them — The accomplishment of the two former signs is supposed, and this only is expressed, because this was more eminent than the former; the others were only transient acts, which passed in private, between two or three persons meeting together; but this was a more permanent and notorious sign, done in a more solemn manner, and before many witnesses.</p><p></p><p>live nya ung poultry and seafood restaurant in game ako mamamya ka tumawag you soon and I will be in the</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ano po ba yan bible </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>bible verse about</p><strong>Answer:</strong><p>David at Nob</p><p><strong>21</strong> [a]David went to Nob, to Ahimelek the priest. Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”</p><p></p><p><strong>2 </strong>David answered Ahimelek the priest, “The king sent me on a mission and said to me, ‘No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.’ As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. 3 Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.”</p><p></p><p>4 But the priest answered David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here—provided the men have kept themselves from women.”</p><p></p><p>5 David replied, “Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever[b] I set out. The men’s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!” 6 So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the Lord and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.</p><p></p><p>7 Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the Lord; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul’s chief shepherd.</p><p></p><p>8 David asked Ahimelek, “Don’t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven’t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king’s mission was urgent.”</p><p></p><p>9 The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.”</p><p></p><p>David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”</p><p></p><p>David at Gath</p><p>10 That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. 11 But the servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances:</p><p></p><p>“‘Saul has slain his thousands,</p><p>    and David his tens of thousands’?”</p><p></p><p>12 David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. 13 So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.</p><p></p><p>14 Achish said to his servants, “Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me? 15 Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?”</p><p></p><p>David at Adullam and Mizpah</p><p>22 David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there. 2 All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their commander. About four hundred men were with him.</p><p></p><p>3 From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?” 4 So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>5 But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.</p><p></p><p>Saul Kills the Priests of Nob</p><p>6 Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul was seated, spear in hand, under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing at his side. 7 He said to them, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? 8 Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today.”</p><p></p><p>9 But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s officials, said, “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek son of Ahitub at Nob. 10 Ahimelek inquired of the Lord for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”</p><p></p><p>11 Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and all the men of his family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king. 12 Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.”</p><p></p><p>“Yes, my lord,” he answered.</p><p></p><p>13 Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?”</p><p></p><p>14 Ahimelek answered the king, “Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king’s son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household? 15 Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father’s family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair.”</p><p></p><p>16 But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelek, you and your whole family.”</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>This is long but hope is Helped</strong></p><p></p><p>#LetsStudyLearners!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Ano ang 1 Samuel 16:7?</strong><p>Ngunit sinabi sa kanya ni Yahweh, “Huwag mong tingnan ang kanyang taas at kakisigan sapagkat hindi siya ang pinili ko. Si Yahweh'y hindi tumitingin nang katulad ng pagtingin ng tao. Panlabas na anyo ang tinitingnan ng tao ngunit sa puso tumitingin si Yahweh.”</p><p></p><strong>Repleksiyon ng 1 Samuel 16:7</strong><p>Ang Diyos ay hindi tumitingin sa labas na kaanyuhan ng isang tao. Hindi ang kakisigan, hindi ang yaman, hindi ang talento o ano pa man na kayang ipagmayabang bilang isang tao. Ang Diyos ay tumitingin lamang sa laman ng ating puso. Sa kabutihan ng ating puso at sa nilalaman nito. Hindi natin kailangan mainggit  sa iba sapagkat lahat ng iyon ay wala sa harapan ng Diyos kung ang kanilang puso ay hindi mabuti at kung ang kanilang buhay ay wala sa ating Diyos. Panatilihin natin na malinis ang ating mga puso at maayos ang ating mga buhay. Tayo ay mamuhay ng may takot sa Diyos at ginagawa ang mga bagay na karapatdapat sa kanyang harapan. </p><p></p><p>Kung nais mo pang makabasa ng mga bible verses, maaari mo ring i-click ang mga links na ito:</p>Bible verse tagalog at paliwanag: https://brainly.ph/question/1113458Verse Bible and explain the verse kahit Tagalog: https://brainly.ph/question/713761<p></p><p><strong>#LetsStudy</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Questions:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. <strong>Why do we call Samuel a judge, prophet, and priest of the Israelites?</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong>Samuel was an honest and fair judge, dispensing God's law impartially. As a prophet, <strong>he exhorted Israel to turn from idolatry and serve God alone.</strong> Despite his personal misgivings, he led Israel from the system of judges to its first monarchy.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Describe/who is Samuel.</strong></p><p>- Samuel, Hebrew Shmuʾel, religious hero in the history of Israel, represented in the Old Testament in every role of leadership open to a Jewish man of his day—seer, priest, judge, prophet, and military leader. His greatest distinction was his role in the establishment of the monarchy in Israel.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Who is Saul?</strong></p><p>- Saul, according to the Hebrew Bible, was the first monarch of the United Kingdom of Israel. His reign, traditionally placed in the late 11th century BCE, supposedly marked the transition of Israel and Judah from a scattered tribal society to organized statehood. </p><p></p><p>4. .<strong>What are his qualities that made him the chosen king of God for Israel?</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong> </strong>God Knew His Heart</p><p>God surprised everyone when He picked theme to be the next King of Israel. It made no sense to anyone except the Lord. He is remembered as the mighty man of God who destroyed the enemies of God.<strong> </strong></p><p></p><p>5. <strong>What were the accomplishments of Saul and Samuel as leaders?</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong> </strong>Saul, Hebrew Shaʾul, first king of Israel. According to the biblical account found mainly in I Samuel, Saul was chosen king both by the judge Samuel and by public acclamation. Saul was similar to the charismatic judges who preceded him in the role of governing; his chief contribution, however, was to defend Israel against its many enemies, especially the Philistines.</p><p></p><p>6. .<strong>What were their weaknesses (sins committed) and the effects of their sins (punishments of being disobedient)? </strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong> </strong>When you turn from Judges to Samuel (the last Judge), you could say Israel was looking for a leader. The leader they chose, was Saul.</p><p>Unfortunately, Saul continued the sad spiral of disobedience. This clip is a good example of the childishness of blatant disobedience<strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p>7. <strong>Lesson learned from Samuel and Saul?</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong>First Samuel is actually the first half of a single book that was divided into two parts, 1 and 2 Samuel because together they were too long to fit on one scroll. The books are names for one of the main characters, who was a prophet and also the last judge to lead Israel.</p><p>The first part of 1 Samuel (1-7) tells about the life of Samuel and how he helped Israel's army fight against enemies that were making raids in Israel. But when he grew old, the people decided to ask the Lord for a king who could lead the army.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>hope </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>helps</strong></p><p><strong>Correct </strong><strong>me </strong><strong>if</strong><strong> I</strong><strong> am</strong><strong> </strong><strong>wrong.</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>&lt;</strong><strong>3</strong></p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about, after</p><p>Hannah had conceived</p><p>Or, "at the revolutions of days" F2; at the end of a year, of a complete year, as Ben Melech, from their return from Shiloh; for it might be some time after their return that she conceived; or rather the sense is, that at nine months' end, the usual time of a woman's going with child from her conception, which is the date here given:</p><p></p><p>that she bare a son:</p><p>was brought to bed of a son:</p><p></p><p>and called his name Samuel, [saying], because I have asked him of the</p><p>Lord;</p><p>one would think rather his name should have been Saul, for the reason given; but, as Ben Gersom observes, givers of names are not always grammatically strict and critical in them, or in the etymology of them, as in the names of Reuben and Noah, in which he instances; and this may be the rather overlooked in a woman, than in a man of learning. According to Kimchi, it is as if it was Saulmeel; that is, "asked of God", and by contraction Samuel; but Hillerus F3 gives a better account of this name, and takes it to be composed of Saul-mul-el, "asked before God", "in the sight of God", "before the ark of God". This name Hannah gave her son (for sometimes the father, and sometimes the mother, gave the name) in memory of the wonderful favour and goodness of God in granting her request; and to impress her own mind with a sense of the obligation she lay under, to perform her vow, and to engage her son the more readily to give up himself to the service of God, when he reflected on his name, and the reason of it.</p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                        Answer<p><strong>1 Samuel 1:27</strong></p><p>"I prayed for this child, and the Lord has granted me what I asked of him."</p><p></p><p>Throughout years of infertility, Hannah faithfully kept on praying to God until God gave her and Elkanah a Son. They named him Samuel, who, in the years to come, became the prophet who anointed King Saul and King David. Hannah knew that without God, Samuel would have not been born. So, with this truth in her heart. She became a good parent by preparing Samuel, at a very young age, to serve and know more about the Lord in the Tabernacle at Shiloh.</p>Explanation<p>To further understand, let us discuss a little bit about Hebrew culture in the times of the Old Testament. First, It is a disgrace to have no Children because it would discontinue the bloodline. Second, being a servant in the Lord's Tabernacle is considered a great honor among the Israelites.</p><p>So, with this information, we could say that Hannah was preparing Samuel for the best life, serving and being friendly with the Lord.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is the Bible Real? - </strong>brainly.ph/question/2903514</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />
