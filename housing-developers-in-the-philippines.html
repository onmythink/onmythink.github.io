On February 4, 2020, a bill proposing the legalization of divorce in the Philippines was 
approved by the Committee on Population and Family Relations in the House of 
Representatives. Currently, the Philippines and the Vatican are the only two sovereign states in 
the world that still prohibit divorce.

The Supreme Court heard a long-awaited argument on Tuesday that could open the door 
to same-sex marriage in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.
The case which was filed by a gay lawyer named Jesus Falcis in 2015, urges the court to 
declare the marriage restriction in the country’s Family Code – which limits marriage to one man 
and one woman – unconstitutional. It also asks the court to recognize marriage equality in the 
Philippines. Falcis argues that the marriage restrictions violate his rights to due process, equal 
protection, and forming a family under the Philippine Constitution.

The key causes of the water pollution are industrial waste, mining activities, sewage and 
waste water, accidental oil leakage, marine dumping, chemical pesticides and fertilizers, burning 
of fossil fuels, animal waste, urban development, global warming, radioactive waste, and leakage 
from sewer lines. There is less water available for drinking, cooking, irrigating crops, and washing
because of pollution.

It would be in the best interest of the country if President Marcos appoints a “permanent” Department of Health secretary, especially since the World Health Organization warned of the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the COVID-19 virus, according to a congressman. “A permanent DOH chief is needed to lead the country in the race for world-class health care,” House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said, noting that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet. The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said. “In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out. The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.” “In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed. “This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said. At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments. “We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</a>

the affluent and the destitute. This predicament is highly evident in the urban setting; behind tall condominiums
and businesses, buildings are homes with poor housing conditions. This somehow demonstrates the lack of
economie progress in our country. Being now familiar with this situation, write a short speech on how you can

                                            In the Philippines, more than one third of the urban population lives in informal settlements. More than half of these urban poor families (1.4 million) live in Metro Manila. In theory, theGovernment has addressed the concerns of the urban poor concern through its “Urban Development and Housing Act” (UDHA), which is intended to provide adequate housing at affordable cost, basic services, and employment opportunities for the slum residents in resettlement areas. However, owing to insufficient capacities at the local level and the lack of appropriate mechanisms to ensure cooperation and consultation in problem solving, the conditions of urban slum residents have only worsened, and they continue to face eviction and demolition from both the government and private landowners.ISSUE: _______________________(social issue, moral issue, economic issue)​</a>

Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet.The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said.“In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out.The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.”“In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed.“This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said.At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments.“We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</a>

Poverty statistics show that 16.6% of the Philippines' population, or approximately 17.6 million people, live below the poverty line. Those who live in rural areas are significantly more likely to be poor, with roughly one-third of those living in poverty working as farmers. The Philippines is more vulnerable to natural calamities than any other country on the planet. These catastrophes, which include typhoons, earthquakes, and cyclones, create horrible devastation and contribute significantly to the country's high poverty rate. Other factors contributing to poverty in the Philippines include limited job creation, slow economic growth, and rapid population expansion. Every 1,000 babies born in the Philippines, 28 die before reaching the age of five. Many of these children die as a result of pneumonia. The Philippines is one of 15 countries that account for more than 75% of all pneumonia deaths worldwide. This high risk of pneumonia is exacerbated by a lower socioeconomic level, which frequently results in limited access to immunizations and treatment choices. In 2019, an estimated 64% of Filipino households are food insecure, and two out of every ten children under the age of five are underweight. Natural calamities, as well as the enormous number of people living in rural areas, add to the Philippines' hunger problem and make food inaccessible to many. The COVID-19 problem has had an impact on all sectors of life in the Philippines, particularly food access. According to a May 2020 research, 4.2 million families were experiencing involuntary hunger, a figure that had more than doubled since December 2019. This is most likely owing to the economic damage and financial troubles that many countries have faced since the outbreak. The Philippines Development Plan was created by the Philippine government in an effort to tackle poverty and hunger while also increasing employment creation in the country. This strategy, which was launched in 2011 and modified in 2017, has shown significant progress in terms of job creation, education, and poverty reduction. Various Filipino non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as others from outside the country have tried to combat poverty in the Philippines. Zero Extreme Poverty PH 2030 (ZEP) has spearheaded the campaign, pledging to end poverty in the country by 2030 by achieving positive change in eight areas: education, environment, health, housing and shelter, livelihoods, peace and human security, and social justice. In 2018, ZEP formed a coalition of several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from the Philippines and throughout the world with the purpose of assisting those living in poverty in the country.</a>

Poverty statistics show that 16.6% of the Philippines' population, or approximately 17.6 million people, live below the poverty line. Those who live in rural areas are significantly more likely to be poor, with roughly one-third of those living in poverty working as farmers. The Philippines is more vulnerable to natural calamities than any other country on the planet. These catastrophes, which include typhoons, earthquakes, and cyclones, create horrible devastation and contribute significantly to the country's high poverty rate. Other factors contributing to poverty in the Philippines include limited job creation, slow economic growth, and rapid population expansion. Every 1,000 babies born in the Philippines, 28 die before reaching the age of five. Many of these children die as a result of pneumonia. The Philippines is one of 15 countries that account for more than 75% of all pneumonia deaths worldwide. This high risk of pneumonia is exacerbated by a lower socioeconomic level, which frequently results in limited access to immunizations and treatment choices. In 2019, an estimated 64% of Filipino households are food insecure, and two out of every ten children under the age of five are underweight. Natural calamities, as well as the enormous number of people living in rural areas, add to the Philippines' hunger problem and make food inaccessible to many. The COVID-19 problem has had an impact on all sectors of life in the Philippines, particularly food access. According to a May 2020 research, 4.2 million families were experiencing involuntary hunger, a figure that had more than doubled since December 2019. This is most likely owing to the economic damage and financial troubles that many countries have faced since the outbreak. The Philippines Development Plan was created by the Philippine government in an effort to tackle poverty and hunger while also increasing employment creation in the country. This strategy, which was launched in 2011 and modified in 2017, has shown significant progress in terms of job creation, education, and poverty reduction. Various Filipino non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as others from outside the country have tried to combat poverty in the Philippines. Zero Extreme Poverty PH 2030 (ZEP) has spearheaded the campaign, pledging to end poverty in the country by 2030 by achieving positive change in eight areas: education, environment, health, housing and shelter, livelihoods, peace and human security, and social justice. In 2018, ZEP formed a coalition of several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from the Philippines and throughout the world with the purpose of assisting those living in poverty in the country.</a>

It would be in the best interest of the country if President Marcos appoints a “permanent” Department of Health secretary, especially since the World Health Organization warned of the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the COVID-19 virus, according to a congressman.“A permanent DOH chief is needed to lead the country in the race for world-class health care,” House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said, noting that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet.The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said.“In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out.The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.”“In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed.“This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said.At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments.“We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</a>

After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

On February 4, 2020, a bill proposing the legalization of divorce in the Philippines was 
approved by the Committee on Population and Family Relations in the House of 
Representatives. Currently, the Philippines and the Vatican are the only two sovereign states in 
the world that still prohibit divorce.

The Supreme Court heard a long-awaited argument on Tuesday that could open the door 
to same-sex marriage in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.
The case which was filed by a gay lawyer named Jesus Falcis in 2015, urges the court to 
declare the marriage restriction in the country’s Family Code – which limits marriage to one man 
and one woman – unconstitutional. It also asks the court to recognize marriage equality in the 
Philippines. Falcis argues that the marriage restrictions violate his rights to due process, equal 
protection, and forming a family under the Philippine Constitution.

The key causes of the water pollution are industrial waste, mining activities, sewage and 
waste water, accidental oil leakage, marine dumping, chemical pesticides and fertilizers, burning 
of fossil fuels, animal waste, urban development, global warming, radioactive waste, and leakage 
from sewer lines. There is less water available for drinking, cooking, irrigating crops, and washing
because of pollution.

                            6. lawmakers urges marcos to name permanent doh chief Pls need ko summary pls po pls. It would be in the best interest of the country if President Marcos appoints a “permanent” Department of Health secretary, especially since the World Health Organization warned of the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the COVID-19 virus, according to a congressman. “A permanent DOH chief is needed to lead the country in the race for world-class health care,” House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said, noting that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet. The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said. “In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out. The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.” “In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed. “This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said. At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments. “We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan has urged President Marcos to appoint a permanent Department of Health (DOH) secretary. Libanan believes that this is necessary in order to lead the country in its fight against the COVID-19 virus and its potential new, deadlier variants. He noted that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire is currently only serving as "officer-in-charge" of the DOH. Libanan also believes that the Philippines has the potential to become a global medical hub like Singapore. He called for effective public-private partnerships and tax incentives to attract international medical schools and research facilities to the country.<p></p><br />

the affluent and the destitute. This predicament is highly evident in the urban setting; behind tall condominiums
and businesses, buildings are homes with poor housing conditions. This somehow demonstrates the lack of

                            10. In the Philippines, more than one third of the urban population lives in informal settlements. More than half of these urban poor families (1.4 million) live in Metro Manila. In theory, theGovernment has addressed the concerns of the urban poor concern through its “Urban Development and Housing Act” (UDHA), which is intended to provide adequate housing at affordable cost, basic services, and employment opportunities for the slum residents in resettlement areas. However, owing to insufficient capacities at the local level and the lack of appropriate mechanisms to ensure cooperation and consultation in problem solving, the conditions of urban slum residents have only worsened, and they continue to face eviction and demolition from both the government and private landowners.ISSUE: _______________________(social issue, moral issue, economic issue)​</h2><br />

Elaborate the statements. 4.How does values developed and what influences its development? 5.Why Philippine Value system degrades as time passed by?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Values play a significant role in making a house into a home. They provide a sense of identity and belonging for the people who live there. A house that is infused with positive values creates a positive and nurturing environment for its inhabitants. On the other hand, a house that lacks values or has negative values can create a negative and toxic atmosphere. To make a house into a home, it is important to identify and cultivate values that align with one's personal beliefs and goals. These values should be reflected in the daily habits and routines of the people living in the home, as well as in the overall atmosphere and decor of the space.</p><p></p><p>2. Technology can change the way we communicate and interact with each other. It can also alter the way we access and share information. Some people may value convenience and efficiency over privacy.</p><p>Others may place a higher value on traditional ways of living. The impact of technology on values varies among individuals and societies.</p><p></p><p>3. Different children learn in different ways. Some may be visual learners, while others may be auditory learners. It is important to identify a child's learning style and tailor teaching methods accordingly. This can increase the child's engagement and understanding of the material. Failing to adapt to a child's learning style may result in frustration and decreased motivation.</p><p></p><p>4. Values can be influenced by family, culture, and life experiences. Early childhood experiences and role models can shape a person's values. Social interactions and group membership can also influence values. Personal goals and beliefs can also play a role in the development of values.</p><p>As a person grows and experiences new things, their values may change and evolve.</p><p></p><p>5. The Philippine Value system has degraded over time because of the increased influence of Western culture, the rise of materialism, the weakening of family relations, the rise of individualism, and the erosion of traditional values and beliefs. The traditional values that were once passed down from generation to generation have been replaced by the modern values of consumerism, materialism, and selfishness. The newer generation has embraced the values of instant gratification, convenience, and pleasure-seeking, which has caused them to neglect the importance of community, family and faith. Additionally, the lack of proper education and guidance for young people has also been a factor in the degradation of the Philippine Value system. Finally, the increasing influence of the media and social media has caused many to lose touch with their Filipino identity, which has further weakened the traditional values and beliefs of the country.</p><br />

Poverty statistics show that 16.6% of the Philippines' population, or approximately 17.6 million people, live below the poverty line. Those who live in rural areas are significantly more likely to be poor, with roughly one-third of those living in poverty working as farmers. The Philippines is more vulnerable to natural calamities than any other country on the planet. These catastrophes, which include typhoons, earthquakes, and cyclones, create horrible devastation and contribute significantly to the country's high poverty rate. Other factors contributing to poverty in the Philippines include limited job creation, slow economic growth, and rapid population expansion. Every 1,000 babies born in the Philippines, 28 die before reaching the age of five. Many of these children die as a result of pneumonia. The Philippines is one of 15 countries that account for more than 75% of all pneumonia deaths worldwide. This high risk of pneumonia is exacerbated by a lower socioeconomic level, which frequently results in limited access to immunizations and treatment choices. In 2019, an estimated 64% of Filipino households are food insecure, and two out of every ten children under the age of five are underweight. Natural calamities, as well as the enormous number of people living in rural areas, add to the Philippines' hunger problem and make food inaccessible to many. The COVID-19 problem has had an impact on all sectors of life in the Philippines, particularly food access. According to a May 2020 research, 4.2 million families were experiencing involuntary hunger, a figure that had more than doubled since December 2019. This is most likely owing to the economic damage and financial troubles that many countries have faced since the outbreak. The Philippines Development Plan was created by the Philippine government in an effort to tackle poverty and hunger while also increasing employment creation in the country. This strategy, which was launched in 2011 and modified in 2017, has shown significant progress in terms of job creation, education, and poverty reduction. Various Filipino non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as others from outside the country have tried to combat poverty in the Philippines. Zero Extreme Poverty PH 2030 (ZEP) has spearheaded the campaign, pledging to end poverty in the country by 2030 by achieving positive change in eight areas: education, environment, health, housing and shelter, livelihoods, peace and human security, and social justice. In 2018, ZEP formed a coalition of several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from the Philippines and throughout the world with the purpose of assisting those living in poverty in the country.</h2><br />

This strategy, which was launched in 2011 and modified in 2017, has shown significant progress in terms of job creation, education, and poverty reduction. Various Filipino non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as others from outside the country have tried to combat poverty in the Philippines. Zero Extreme Poverty PH 2030 (ZEP) has spearheaded the campaign, pledging to end poverty in the country by 2030 by achieving positive change in eight areas: education, environment, health, housing and shelter, livelihoods, peace and human security, and social justice. In 2018, ZEP formed a coalition of several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from the Philippines and throughout the world with the purpose of assisting those living in poverty in the country.</h2><br />

                            30. Reading and Writing Skills - Asynchronous Week - Activity 2 out of 4. Identification. Identify what Pattern of Development is used to develop the idea. Answers only. Write the answers on a one whole sheet of paper. Identify the Pattern of Development used in the thesis statements. 1. Teeth bleaching can be done in five simple steps. 2. All provincial buses should not be allowed to pass through EDSA. 3. iPhone 6 has many features that make it stand out in the market. 4. There are many reasons why unemployment continues to increase. 5. Drinking cough syrup may lead to various side effects. Identify the pattern of development in each paragraph. 6. To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />
