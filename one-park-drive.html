                                            B. Read the paragraphs below. Underline the seven idioms you find. On Saturday morning, Blanca and her friends rode their bikes to Mill Creek Park. They were joining their neighbors and some local businesses to help clean up the park. Mr. Wu, the organizer of the cleanup, spoke to the crowd that had gathered at the gates of the park. "I'm so pleased to see you all," he began. "This park belongs to all of us. If no one cared about our public spaces, we'd all be in the same boat. If we stick together, we can make amazing things happen!" The crowd cheered, grabbed their recycling bags, and put on rubber gloves. Blanca, Louie, and Sara headed for the park trail. As they picked up trash, it dawned on Blanca that the environment wasn't just something she learned about at school or on TV. Blanca decided that caring about the environment was something worth sticking out her neck for. A couple of hours later, the group gathered again. They snacked on bagels and hot cider as Mr. Wu beamed at the crowd. He looks like he has something up his sleeve, Blanca thought to herself. "As you know, we have people from several different businesses here today. I asked them for donations for Green Space Kentucky. I thought there was a slim chance we'd raise much money this way, but I was wrong. They've offered to donate a total of $5,000 dollars to our cause!" The owner of a local bakery grinned and shook her head. "Mr. Wu drives a hard bargain," she said. "How could we say no?"​</a>

                                            Shery was scheduled to meet a potential client inside a mall. She was trying to find an empty slot and kept going around for 15 minutes.  She finally spotted an empty slot and tried to park facing the wall.  Unfortunately, the angle of her car was not enough for her to drive in the parking slot, so, she put her car on reverse and drove a few feet back so she can adjust the angle of her car.  Suddenly, another car appeared and took her spot.  He quickly went down, and winked at Shery.  He blurted out “daig nang mabilis ang mabagal “  and proceeded to walk away. Shery was fuming mad because she was already running late.  She suddenly shifted gears, stepped on the gas pedal and aimed for the car of the driver who took her slot. She slammed her car into the back of the arrogant driver’s car.  The man who owned the car stood shocked in his place.  Shery went down, went through her wallet and handed her business card.  She gave him a tight smile and said “daig nang mayaman ang mabilis”. She went back in her car and went around to look for an empty parking space. What could Sherry have done to constructively call out the rude driver?

                                            explain the purpose of this text Requiring More Fuel-Efficient Cars, we live in tough times. Gas prices continue to increase, the economy is falling apart, and some believe that the environment is changing for the worst. All of these problems can be related to two things, the cost of fuel and the inefficient vehicles we drive. Both of these problems can be solved with one solution. This solution could not only help the environment, it could help the economy, and advance technology. We should require that the automobile manufacturers should produce more fuel - efficient vehicles.  To start with, this solution could do a variety of things including helping the environment. Some believe that all the pollutants we put into the atmosphere are causing global warming, now this may or may not be true, but what is true is that these pollutants cause a number of unsightly and harmful things. These pollutants cause a haze to appear over large cities that not only looks terrible, but can cause damage. When it rains this haze collects in the rain droplets and creates a form of rain called acid rain. Acid rain not only eats away at buildings and cars, but also makes the soil at farms very high in acid levels, which can lead to the death of crops. This haze can naturally go away, but when we use inefficient vehicles which add more and more pollutants to the haze, it will never leave, it will only grow. If we were to use more fuel - efficient cars though, the haze would start to lessen and go away. The pollutants from vehicles aren’t the only thing destroying the environment, we are too. With the raise in demand for crude oil the state of Utah has allowed oil companies to drill in national parks. These huge oil drillers are now going to be allowed in the national parks. Unless we start to drive more fuel - efficient cars, and lower the demand for crude oil, these metal monsters will be able to destroy the natural beauty of our national parks.  All in all, building more fuel - efficient cars would be a good thing; it would help​</a>

                            17. B. Read the paragraphs below. Underline the seven idioms you find. On Saturday morning, Blanca and her friends rode their bikes to Mill Creek Park. They were joining their neighbors and some local businesses to help clean up the park. Mr. Wu, the organizer of the cleanup, spoke to the crowd that had gathered at the gates of the park. "I'm so pleased to see you all," he began. "This park belongs to all of us. If no one cared about our public spaces, we'd all be in the same boat. If we stick together, we can make amazing things happen!" The crowd cheered, grabbed their recycling bags, and put on rubber gloves. Blanca, Louie, and Sara headed for the park trail. As they picked up trash, it dawned on Blanca that the environment wasn't just something she learned about at school or on TV. Blanca decided that caring about the environment was something worth sticking out her neck for. A couple of hours later, the group gathered again. They snacked on bagels and hot cider as Mr. Wu beamed at the crowd. He looks like he has something up his sleeve, Blanca thought to herself. "As you know, we have people from several different businesses here today. I asked them for donations for Green Space Kentucky. I thought there was a slim chance we'd raise much money this way, but I was wrong. They've offered to donate a total of $5,000 dollars to our cause!" The owner of a local bakery grinned and shook her head. "Mr. Wu drives a hard bargain," she said. "How could we say no?"​</h2><br />

                            30. explain the purpose of this text Requiring More Fuel-Efficient Cars, we live in tough times. Gas prices continue to increase, the economy is falling apart, and some believe that the environment is changing for the worst. All of these problems can be related to two things, the cost of fuel and the inefficient vehicles we drive. Both of these problems can be solved with one solution. This solution could not only help the environment, it could help the economy, and advance technology. We should require that the automobile manufacturers should produce more fuel - efficient vehicles.  To start with, this solution could do a variety of things including helping the environment. Some believe that all the pollutants we put into the atmosphere are causing global warming, now this may or may not be true, but what is true is that these pollutants cause a number of unsightly and harmful things. These pollutants cause a haze to appear over large cities that not only looks terrible, but can cause damage. When it rains this haze collects in the rain droplets and creates a form of rain called acid rain. Acid rain not only eats away at buildings and cars, but also makes the soil at farms very high in acid levels, which can lead to the death of crops. This haze can naturally go away, but when we use inefficient vehicles which add more and more pollutants to the haze, it will never leave, it will only grow. If we were to use more fuel - efficient cars though, the haze would start to lessen and go away. The pollutants from vehicles aren’t the only thing destroying the environment, we are too. With the raise in demand for crude oil the state of Utah has allowed oil companies to drill in national parks. These huge oil drillers are now going to be allowed in the national parks. Unless we start to drive more fuel - efficient cars, and lower the demand for crude oil, these metal monsters will be able to destroy the natural beauty of our national parks.  All in all, building more fuel - efficient cars would be a good thing; it would help​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pollution. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>  is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</p><br />
