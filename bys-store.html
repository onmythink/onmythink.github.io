                        <p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>If Yvanna has a square garden with a side of length 5 feet, and she increases the length by s feet and then decreases the width by 2 feet, the new rectangular garden will have dimensions of (5 + s) feet by (5 - 2) feet. The area of this garden can be represented by the trinomial (5 + s)(5 - 2), which simplifies to 5s - 10. This trinomial represents the area of the new rectangular garden in terms of the variable s.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
