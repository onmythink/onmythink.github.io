El Tigre, our former teachers specially to our adviser,Mr. Reden Juego, to our former class president, Ms. Rashina Dela Cruz, to Rina'sparents, Mr. and Mrs. Delamanta, guests and of course to our dearest debutant, RinaDelamanta.It was during my grade 7 years that I met this wonderful woman in front of you.She was a woman full of warmth and energy. That's how I describe her. First day ofclass, she immediately extended her hands to me, trying to make friends with me. ButI was a shy type boy back then, so I did not respond. However, with the golden heartthat she had which is still true until now, she didn't not give up on me. She kept onsaying hi and hello even though I wasn't returning the same kind of vibe to her. Sheeven shared with me her snacks during our break time. Because of that determination,she finally won my heart. We started hanging out together and became so close to thepoint that people suspect that we are dating. But, in all honesty, Rina and I are justbest friends. That's why I my gift for her tonight is a bracelet beaded with energy stonesto remind her that she is one of the sources of my energy.
