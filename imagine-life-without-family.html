                                            CHALLENGES ARE NORMAL OCCURRENCES IN LIFE. NO SINGLE PERSON CAN SAY THAT HE OR SHE HAS NEVER ENCOUNTERED A CHALLENGE. FROM THE TIME YOU WERE BORN AS A BABY, YOU STRUGGLED TO CRAWL, TO WALK AND TO TALK. AS A TODDLER, YOU STRUGGLED TO CONTAIN YOUR TANTRUMS WHEN YOU DID NOT GET WHAT YOU WANTED. AS YOU ADDED YEARS IN YOUR LIFE, YOU BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT THE CHALLENGES YOU EXPERIENCE BECAME MORE VARIED, COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT THAN BEFORE.THIS HEALTH CRISIS SITUATION THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IS A CHALLENGE IN ITSELF. WE SOMETIMES STRUGGLE TO REMEMBER AND APPLY ALL THE NECESSARY HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS FROM AUTHORITIES. WE STRUGGLE TO AVOID GOING TO PLACES IF IT IS NOT NECESSARY. WE STRUGGLE TO FIND SAFE WAYS TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES WHILE OBSERVING PHYSICAL DISTANCING. EVEN THE LEARNING SETUP IS A CHALLENGE NOT ONLY FOR YOU BUT FOR YOUR CLASSMATES, PARENTS, FAMILY MEMBERS, TEACHERS, AND FRIENDS, AS WELL.THUS EVERYONE EXPERIENCES CHALLENGES EVEN BEFORE COVID-19. COULD YOU IMAGINE A LIFE WITHOUT CHALLENGES? A LIFE WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO OVERCOME ANY CHALLENGE AT ALL? REGARDLESS OF IT'S KIND, WE MUST CONSTANTLY EQUIP OURSELVES WITH WAYS ON HOW WE CAN RISE ABOVE THESE CHALLENGES AND DEAL WITH IT POSITIVELY, WE HAVE TO DEVELOPE EFFECTIVE STUDY HABITS FOR THE ATTAINMENT FOR EXEMPLARY PERFORMANCE NOT ONLY IN SCHOOL BUT IN LIFE LATER ON.​</a>

                                            By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</a>

1) Therelationshipbetweencultureandsocietycanbedescribedinthefollowingway.
2) Culturalrelativismissometimespositedastheoppositeofethnocentrism.
3) Imagination is the capacity to shift from one perspective to another—from the political to
the psychological; from examination of a single family to comparative assessment of the
national budgets of the world.
4) Troubles occur within the character of the individual and within the range of his immediate
relations with others
5) Issues have to do with matters that transcend these local environments of the individual
and the range of his inner life.
6) The sociological imagination enables us to grasp history and biography and the relations
between the two within society.
7) It helps us investigate and compare societies without relating them to an intellectually
irrelevant spiritual scale.
8) Many began to criticise the overly neat and tidy picture suggested in the dominant concept
of culture, from a variety of viewpoints.
9) Donald Brown presented 161 different definitions of culture. It would not be possible to
consider the majority of these definitions.
10)The tension between the universal and the particular has been immensely productive in
anthropology, and it remains an important one. It is commonly discussed, inside and outside anthropology, through the concept of ethnocentrism.</a>

                            5. By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</h2><br />

the psychological; from examination of a single family to comparative assessment of the
national budgets of the world.

and the range of his inner life.

irrelevant spiritual scale.

of culture, from a variety of viewpoints.
