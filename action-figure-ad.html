                                            Directions: Read and analyze very carefully this sample position paper. Then, accomplish the table by doing what are asked. "DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? "Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016, they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of people with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invested in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot. of people to think twice before taking their first puff.Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age.To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there.As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their dangerous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day become more obvious to them too.INTRODUCTION•What is the issue about?•Background • Relevance•Thesis statementBODY•Argument•Counter-argument •Evidences presentedCONCLUSION •Restated position •Course of action presented​</a>

                                            Not surprisingly, only 1.34 million hectares out of 4.66 million hectares of irrigable land was actually irrigated. Only 17 percent of the Philippine road network was paved, compared to the 82 percent in Thailand and 75 percent in Malaysia. Crop yield across the board was anemic, with the average yield in rice of 2.87 MT per hectare way below average yields in China, Vietnam, and 81 Thailand. Confronted with governments that played an aggressive, activist role in protecting and promoting their agriculture not only in the US and the EU but in the neighboring Asian countries as well, the Philippines was ill-equipped to enter the AOA. To prevent the agricultural sector from becoming a roadblock to the ratification of the WTO agreement, the Ramos administration promised to appropriate and release funds for agricultural modernization and safety nets. The fund promised-called the Department of Agriculture Action Plan-totaled Php 128 billion, to be released at the rate of Php32 billion annually. The figure included "Php27 billion for the improvement of irrigation facilities, Php8 billion for the construction of farm-to-market roads, Php 762 million for the improvement of post- harvest facilities, and Php64 million for the installation of grain centers."83 However, according to one agricultural expert, only 44 percent of the Php 32 billion promised for 1995 was appropriated. Of this amount, funding for new projects-i.e.. projects begun after ratification of the WTO agreement-amounted to the exceedingly small sum of Php2.8 billion. In 1996, the proposed Php32 billion was reduced to Php 14.6 billion, of which the funding for new projects was, at Php2.2 billion, even lower than the 1995 figure." Seven years later, the Department of Agriculture admitted that only 50 percent of the proposed Department of Agriculture Action Plan had been released.85 84 The failure of the safety net program was supposed to be addressed by the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA) passed in 1998 which provided for comprehensive government assistance covering such areas as irrigation, post-harvest facilities, credit and financing, and research and development. But, as one report noted, "despite having a legislated annual budgetary allocation, AFMA was not able to take off the ground as government could not even meet the annual budgetary needs of the Department of Agriculture." What limited amounts were appropriated of the original proposed Php35 billion safety net program, some charged, were largely diverted to urban projects such as flyovers during the Ramos period.87 During the ratification debate, pro-WTO advocates promoted the vision that the AOA would create a situation where the Philippines would fill production niches in which it would have the "comparative advantage" such as the cultivation of high-value-added export crops such as cutflowers, asparagus, broccoli, and snow peas. These advocates, such as then-Secretary of Agriculture Roberto Sebastian, did not do their homework. The shift to high value "non-traditional agricultural exports" (NTAES) requires investment that is simply not within the reach of small producers. For instance, in the case of cutflowers, data from Ecuador reveals an average initial capital investment of $200,000 per hectare. Annual input costs are also high, with the costs of agrochemicals alone coming to over $18,900 per hectare. 88 In the case of snow peas, broccoli, and cauliflower, annual production costs, according to data from Guatemala, comes to $3,145, $1,096, and $971 per hectare respectively, compared to $219 per hectare for corn.89 Moreover, competitive advantage in these crops can only be achieved through significant outlays in technological support and research and development.

We are heavily interested in helping teaching assistants enhance their feedback skills. Furthermore, cited by Struyven, Dochy and Janssens (2008) if understudies are considered to be "particularly important in a procedure of progress and institution life "instead of "possible recipients of progress" (Fullan, 2001, p. 151), including understudies when contemplating change and understanding instructive advancement comes in normal. Truth be told, amid the procedure of progress, understudies may endure comparative sentiments of vulnerability and uncertainty at the begin and delights of authority, achievement, what's more, scholarly development when change has demonstrated to work. In this appreciation, understudy instructors in educator preparing programs are fascinating subjects. On one hand , they are understudies during the time spent change while encountering new showing strategies or appraisal modes; then again, they are to serve the capacity of instructors actualizing change practically speaking and cited by Stivers and Phillips (2008) The accreditation agencies are suggesting that educators should shift their focus from what to students learn.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Coaching Training Program aims to train Teaching Assistants to become efficient coaches in order to effectively develop and motivate student teams. The focus is on enhancing feedback skills. Involving students in the process of change and educational development is important as they are considered important in the process of progress and institutional life. Student teachers in educator training programs are interesting subjects as they experience new teaching methods and assessment modes and are also required to implement changes in practice. Accreditation agencies suggest that educators shift their focus from what students learn to ensure consistency with new assessment figures and to maintain accreditation standards. The paper presents a nested hierarchy of approaches that encompass different ways of acquiring knowledge of standards, including an ad hoc and serendipitous approach, an explicit approach, and a social constructivist approach.</p><br />

"Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016, they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of people with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invested in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot. of people to think twice before taking their first puff.Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age.To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there.As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their dangerous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day become more obvious to them too.INTRODUCTION•What is the issue about?•Background • Relevance•Thesis statementBODY•Argument•Counter-argument •Evidences presentedCONCLUSION •Restated position •Course of action presented​</h2><br />

Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking</p><br />

                            18. Not surprisingly, only 1.34 million hectares out of 4.66 million hectares of irrigable land was actually irrigated. Only 17 percent of the Philippine road network was paved, compared to the 82 percent in Thailand and 75 percent in Malaysia. Crop yield across the board was anemic, with the average yield in rice of 2.87 MT per hectare way below average yields in China, Vietnam, and 81 Thailand. Confronted with governments that played an aggressive, activist role in protecting and promoting their agriculture not only in the US and the EU but in the neighboring Asian countries as well, the Philippines was ill-equipped to enter the AOA. To prevent the agricultural sector from becoming a roadblock to the ratification of the WTO agreement, the Ramos administration promised to appropriate and release funds for agricultural modernization and safety nets. The fund promised-called the Department of Agriculture Action Plan-totaled Php 128 billion, to be released at the rate of Php32 billion annually. The figure included "Php27 billion for the improvement of irrigation facilities, Php8 billion for the construction of farm-to-market roads, Php 762 million for the improvement of post- harvest facilities, and Php64 million for the installation of grain centers."83 However, according to one agricultural expert, only 44 percent of the Php 32 billion promised for 1995 was appropriated. Of this amount, funding for new projects-i.e.. projects begun after ratification of the WTO agreement-amounted to the exceedingly small sum of Php2.8 billion. In 1996, the proposed Php32 billion was reduced to Php 14.6 billion, of which the funding for new projects was, at Php2.2 billion, even lower than the 1995 figure." Seven years later, the Department of Agriculture admitted that only 50 percent of the proposed Department of Agriculture Action Plan had been released.85 84 The failure of the safety net program was supposed to be addressed by the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA) passed in 1998 which provided for comprehensive government assistance covering such areas as irrigation, post-harvest facilities, credit and financing, and research and development. But, as one report noted, "despite having a legislated annual budgetary allocation, AFMA was not able to take off the ground as government could not even meet the annual budgetary needs of the Department of Agriculture." What limited amounts were appropriated of the original proposed Php35 billion safety net program, some charged, were largely diverted to urban projects such as flyovers during the Ramos period.87 During the ratification debate, pro-WTO advocates promoted the vision that the AOA would create a situation where the Philippines would fill production niches in which it would have the "comparative advantage" such as the cultivation of high-value-added export crops such as cutflowers, asparagus, broccoli, and snow peas. These advocates, such as then-Secretary of Agriculture Roberto Sebastian, did not do their homework. The shift to high value "non-traditional agricultural exports" (NTAES) requires investment that is simply not within the reach of small producers. For instance, in the case of cutflowers, data from Ecuador reveals an average initial capital investment of $200,000 per hectare. Annual input costs are also high, with the costs of agrochemicals alone coming to over $18,900 per hectare. 88 In the case of snow peas, broccoli, and cauliflower, annual production costs, according to data from Guatemala, comes to $3,145, $1,096, and $971 per hectare respectively, compared to $219 per hectare for corn.89 Moreover, competitive advantage in these crops can only be achieved through significant outlays in technological support and research and development.
