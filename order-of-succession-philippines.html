STEP JUAN
Tomas Leonor, a graduate of Fine Arts from the University of the Philippines, founded and organized Step Juan, an expedition that aims to raise funds for children with cancer. He is a freelance artist and a mountaineer. He volunteers for some environment organizations.
When he was a small boy, he suffered a few health problems. His dream was to travel around the Philippines. In 2009, he started to travel but by foot to help children with cancer. He started from the northern part of the Philippines. He earned 1.5 million pesos from walking around Luzon. By 2012, he earned Php 500, 000 more. The amount was earmarked for his project of helping children with cancer. He gives medical aid and promotes public awareness about the plight of these children.
Tomas is a true modern Filipino hero. He is hardworking, persevering, and helpful. He gave up convenience for the sake of others. He never gave up hope on the children of our country. He does what is best for others and cares for them more than he cares for himself.
According to Tomas: “Real success is when you know in your heart that you have given it all your best and you have not used or stepped on anyone in order to reach that goal.”

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I believe we can only come up with the veracious account of our history if the government will first obliterate the proliferation of fake news. It would be difficult to assert the truth of the past if we are competing with "fake news"  and the likes of historical revisionism in feeding our citizens with the truth of our history.   </p><p>The government on its part must see to it that information released and published by the media must be accurate, reliable, and should have no trace of fabrication. Majority of the people get their information from GMA, ABS-CBN, TV-5, RAPPLER, INQUIRER, STAR, TIKTIK, and the likes. Thus these companies must only feed the public with news that are accurate and bias free. </p><p>It would have been great if the government would take the initiative to form a committee that is task to collect all historical facts about the Philippines and use these as standard and the ultimate source in Educating the people especially the youth about our history. In this way, we can do away from  having a divided sense of history. But like I said, the facts collected must be accurate and should have no trace of biases, it must be research based and statistics based. </p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2. Mining remains a controversial and a contemporary issue. We've heard a lot of news which regards to the negative contribution of it. Nevertheless, we cannot deny the fact that numbers of Filipinos were beneficiaries of mining. It is a fact that it is a major source of income and undoubtedly a contributor to economic growth. To stop mining would be a loss. I think it's okey to continue still, but in moderation with less abuse and proper usage.</p><br />
