                                            “See you later” is a way of saying “goodbye” in American English and it often does not mean “I’ll see you later.” An American woman said “See you later” to a new immigrant in the U.S., who understood it literally. The American said “See you later” to her friend as they were leaving an office building. The American went away but the immigrant friend stayed in front of the building for twenty minutes! Later she  told her friend about this and was embarrassed about the misunderstanding. This is how she remembers her first week in the U.S.
