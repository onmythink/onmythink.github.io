and businesses, buildings are homes with poor housing conditions. This somehow demonstrates the lack of
economie progress in our country. Being now familiar with this situation, write a short speech on how you can
promote an inclusive system of development where the least, the lost, and the last will enjoy economic progress

                                            In the Philippines, more than one third of the urban population lives in informal settlements. More than half of these urban poor families (1.4 million) live in Metro Manila. In theory, theGovernment has addressed the concerns of the urban poor concern through its “Urban Development and Housing Act” (UDHA), which is intended to provide adequate housing at affordable cost, basic services, and employment opportunities for the slum residents in resettlement areas. However, owing to insufficient capacities at the local level and the lack of appropriate mechanisms to ensure cooperation and consultation in problem solving, the conditions of urban slum residents have only worsened, and they continue to face eviction and demolition from both the government and private landowners.ISSUE: _______________________(social issue, moral issue, economic issue)​</a>

                                            Interpret the data given about poverty in 5-10 sentences.
Poverty statistics show that 16.6% of the Philippines' population, or approximately 17.6 million people, live below the poverty line. Those who live in rural areas are significantly more likely to be poor, with roughly one-third of those living in poverty working as farmers. The Philippines is more vulnerable to natural calamities than any other country on the planet. These catastrophes, which include typhoons, earthquakes, and cyclones, create horrible devastation and contribute significantly to the country's high poverty rate. Other factors contributing to poverty in the Philippines include limited job creation, slow economic growth, and rapid population expansion. Every 1,000 babies born in the Philippines, 28 die before reaching the age of five. Many of these children die as a result of pneumonia. The Philippines is one of 15 countries that account for more than 75% of all pneumonia deaths worldwide. This high risk of pneumonia is exacerbated by a lower socioeconomic level, which frequently results in limited access to immunizations and treatment choices. In 2019, an estimated 64% of Filipino households are food insecure, and two out of every ten children under the age of five are underweight. Natural calamities, as well as the enormous number of people living in rural areas, add to the Philippines' hunger problem and make food inaccessible to many. The COVID-19 problem has had an impact on all sectors of life in the Philippines, particularly food access. According to a May 2020 research, 4.2 million families were experiencing involuntary hunger, a figure that had more than doubled since December 2019. This is most likely owing to the economic damage and financial troubles that many countries have faced since the outbreak. The Philippines Development Plan was created by the Philippine government in an effort to tackle poverty and hunger while also increasing employment creation in the country. This strategy, which was launched in 2011 and modified in 2017, has shown significant progress in terms of job creation, education, and poverty reduction. Various Filipino non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as others from outside the country have tried to combat poverty in the Philippines. Zero Extreme Poverty PH 2030 (ZEP) has spearheaded the campaign, pledging to end poverty in the country by 2030 by achieving positive change in eight areas: education, environment, health, housing and shelter, livelihoods, peace and human security, and social justice. In 2018, ZEP formed a coalition of several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from the Philippines and throughout the world with the purpose of assisting those living in poverty in the country.</a>

Poverty statistics show that 16.6% of the Philippines' population, or approximately 17.6 million people, live below the poverty line. Those who live in rural areas are significantly more likely to be poor, with roughly one-third of those living in poverty working as farmers. The Philippines is more vulnerable to natural calamities than any other country on the planet. These catastrophes, which include typhoons, earthquakes, and cyclones, create horrible devastation and contribute significantly to the country's high poverty rate. Other factors contributing to poverty in the Philippines include limited job creation, slow economic growth, and rapid population expansion. Every 1,000 babies born in the Philippines, 28 die before reaching the age of five. Many of these children die as a result of pneumonia. The Philippines is one of 15 countries that account for more than 75% of all pneumonia deaths worldwide. This high risk of pneumonia is exacerbated by a lower socioeconomic level, which frequently results in limited access to immunizations and treatment choices. In 2019, an estimated 64% of Filipino households are food insecure, and two out of every ten children under the age of five are underweight. Natural calamities, as well as the enormous number of people living in rural areas, add to the Philippines' hunger problem and make food inaccessible to many. The COVID-19 problem has had an impact on all sectors of life in the Philippines, particularly food access. According to a May 2020 research, 4.2 million families were experiencing involuntary hunger, a figure that had more than doubled since December 2019. This is most likely owing to the economic damage and financial troubles that many countries have faced since the outbreak. The Philippines Development Plan was created by the Philippine government in an effort to tackle poverty and hunger while also increasing employment creation in the country. This strategy, which was launched in 2011 and modified in 2017, has shown significant progress in terms of job creation, education, and poverty reduction. Various Filipino non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as others from outside the country have tried to combat poverty in the Philippines. Zero Extreme Poverty PH 2030 (ZEP) has spearheaded the campaign, pledging to end poverty in the country by 2030 by achieving positive change in eight areas: education, environment, health, housing and shelter, livelihoods, peace and human security, and social justice. In 2018, ZEP formed a coalition of several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from the Philippines and throughout the world with the purpose of assisting those living in poverty in the country.</a>

                            13. In the Philippines, more than one third of the urban population lives in informal settlements. More than half of these urban poor families (1.4 million) live in Metro Manila. In theory, theGovernment has addressed the concerns of the urban poor concern through its “Urban Development and Housing Act” (UDHA), which is intended to provide adequate housing at affordable cost, basic services, and employment opportunities for the slum residents in resettlement areas. However, owing to insufficient capacities at the local level and the lack of appropriate mechanisms to ensure cooperation and consultation in problem solving, the conditions of urban slum residents have only worsened, and they continue to face eviction and demolition from both the government and private landowners.ISSUE: _______________________(social issue, moral issue, economic issue)​</h2><br />

                            16. Interpret the data given about poverty in 5-10 sentences.
Poverty statistics show that 16.6% of the Philippines' population, or approximately 17.6 million people, live below the poverty line. Those who live in rural areas are significantly more likely to be poor, with roughly one-third of those living in poverty working as farmers. The Philippines is more vulnerable to natural calamities than any other country on the planet. These catastrophes, which include typhoons, earthquakes, and cyclones, create horrible devastation and contribute significantly to the country's high poverty rate. Other factors contributing to poverty in the Philippines include limited job creation, slow economic growth, and rapid population expansion. Every 1,000 babies born in the Philippines, 28 die before reaching the age of five. Many of these children die as a result of pneumonia. The Philippines is one of 15 countries that account for more than 75% of all pneumonia deaths worldwide. This high risk of pneumonia is exacerbated by a lower socioeconomic level, which frequently results in limited access to immunizations and treatment choices. In 2019, an estimated 64% of Filipino households are food insecure, and two out of every ten children under the age of five are underweight. Natural calamities, as well as the enormous number of people living in rural areas, add to the Philippines' hunger problem and make food inaccessible to many. The COVID-19 problem has had an impact on all sectors of life in the Philippines, particularly food access. According to a May 2020 research, 4.2 million families were experiencing involuntary hunger, a figure that had more than doubled since December 2019. This is most likely owing to the economic damage and financial troubles that many countries have faced since the outbreak. The Philippines Development Plan was created by the Philippine government in an effort to tackle poverty and hunger while also increasing employment creation in the country. This strategy, which was launched in 2011 and modified in 2017, has shown significant progress in terms of job creation, education, and poverty reduction. Various Filipino non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as others from outside the country have tried to combat poverty in the Philippines. Zero Extreme Poverty PH 2030 (ZEP) has spearheaded the campaign, pledging to end poverty in the country by 2030 by achieving positive change in eight areas: education, environment, health, housing and shelter, livelihoods, peace and human security, and social justice. In 2018, ZEP formed a coalition of several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from the Philippines and throughout the world with the purpose of assisting those living in poverty in the country.</h2><br />
