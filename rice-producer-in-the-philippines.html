                                            Marikina is known as the "Shoe Capital of the Philippines" for its famous shoe industry. It is the biggest manufacturer of shoes in the Philippines, producing almost 70% of shoes made in the country. It is also the home of the world’s largest pair of shoes certified by the Guiness Book of World Records. Marikina is in the northeast of Metro Manila and is currently one of the most competitive cities in the country. Before becoming known for its shoes, Marikina was recognized as a big producer of rice and vegetables. It was first inhabited by the Augustinians in 1500, followed by the Jesuits in 1630. The town was first called “Marquina,” after the Spanish governor-general Felix Berenguer de Marquina; the name was changed to “Marikina” during the American occupation in 1901. It became a city on December 8, 1996. A. Literally NonfictionB. Procedural TextC. Expository TextD. Persuasive Text​</a>

Save Rice, Save Lives The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reports that "one fifth of the world's population more than a billion people - depend on rice cultivation for their livelihoods". About 90% of this rice is grown in Asia by poor farmers from the rural areas. The Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI) says that "each Filipino wastes 2 tablespoons of cooked rice every day. When not wasted, this could result in import savings, as high as P6.2 billion and could feed 2.6 million hungry Filipinos in a year". For Filipinos, every meal is incomplete without rice. It is their main source of carbohydrates. If rice is wasted, more rice should be produced, which might affect its seling price. If more rice is needed by consumers and not enough rice is produced, the country could resort into importing rice from other counties. Besides, growing rice is not that easy and cheap. Farmers have to buy fertilizers, pay for seeding, spend for irrigation, and the use of equipment. Eat your rice right - the right amount, no leftovers. Be "rice-ponsible".

Save Rice, Save Lives The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reports that "one fifth of the world's population more than a billion people - depend on rice cultivation for their livelihoods". About 90% of this rice is grown in Asia by poor farmers from the rural areas. The Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI) says that "each Filipino wastes 2 tablespoons of cooked rice every day. When not wasted, this could result in import savings, as high as P6.2 billion and could feed 2.6 million hungry Filipinos in a year". For Filipinos, every meal is incomplete without rice. It is their main source of carbohydrates. If rice is wasted, more rice should be produced, which might affect its seling price. If more rice is needed by consumers and not enough rice is produced, the country could resort into importing rice from other counties. Besides, growing rice is not that easy and cheap. Farmers have to buy fertilizers, pay for seeding, spend for irrigation, and the use of equipment. Eat your rice right - the right amount, no leftovers. Be "rice-ponsible".

                            26. B. Directions: Below is an example of an informational text called explanation. Read the text and fill out the chart after. Save Rice, Save Lives The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reports that "one fifth of the world's population- -more than a billion people—depend on rice cultivation for their livelihoods." About 90% of this rice is grown in Asia by poor farmers from the rural areas. The Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI) says that, "Each Filipino wastes 2 tablespoons of cooked rice every day. When not wasted, this could result in import savings as high as P6.2 billion and could feed 2.6 million hungry Filipinos in a year." For Filipinos, every meal is incomplete without rice. It is their main source of carbohydrates. If rice is wasted, more rice should be produced, which might affect its selling price. If more rice is needed by consumers, and not enough rice is produced, the country could resort to importing rice from other countries. Besides, growing rice is not that easy and cheap. Farmers have to buy fertilizers, pay for seedlings, spend for irrigation and the use of equipment. Eat your rice right--the right amount, no leftovers. Be "rice-ponsible”. “Save Rice, Save Lives," the campaign says. If you do, you save lives. Wouldn't it be more than nice?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Because our country does not value our local farmers to a higher degree than rice imports. This undervaluation for our local farmers can be seen in many media; even [some] school textbooks consider farming as a job for the poor or a less dignified job. Because of this, other big-time countries capitalize on the Philippines for rice exports. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Sorry if I am being political here.
