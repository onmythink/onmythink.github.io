                                            Having a dog in your home can serve many purposes, but living with a poorly trained dog is not worth the mess. These mangy mutts will go potty inside of your home. This can stain your floors and make your house smell bad. In order to prevent this you have to teach your dog to go potty outside. This may require you to go on a lot more walks with your dog. You may have to sit outside for long periods of time while you are waiting for your dog to use it. But it will be worth it to not have a bunch of dog mess all over your house. So if you love your dog but hate cleaning dog-doo off of the rug, teach your dog the right way to go.

                                            The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse by Aesop Now you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a visit to his cousin in the country. He was rough and ready, this cousin, but he loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome. Beans and bacon, cheese, and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely. The Town Mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare and said: 'I cannot understand, Cousin, how you can put up with such poor food as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the country; come you with me and I will show you how to live. When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life.' Not sooner said than done: the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night. You will want some refreshment after our long journey,' said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room. There they found the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes, and all that was nice Suddenly they heard growling and barking. ' What is that?' said the country mouse. : It is only the dogs of the house' answered the other. ' Only!' said the Country mouse. ' I do not like that music at my dinner'. Just at that moment,nthe door Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper down and runoff. ' Good-bye, Cousin,' said the country mouse, 'What! going so soon?' said the other. ' Yes' he replied, ' better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fearQuestion:1.

                            5. Having a dog in your home can serve many purposes, but living with a poorly trained dog is not worth the mess. These mangy mutts will go potty inside of your home. This can stain your floors and make your house smell bad. In order to prevent this you have to teach your dog to go potty outside. This may require you to go on a lot more walks with your dog. You may have to sit outside for long periods of time while you are waiting for your dog to use it. But it will be worth it to not have a bunch of dog mess all over your house. So if you love your dog but hate cleaning dog-doo off of the rug, teach your dog the right way to go. Problem   :Solutions:​</h2><br />

                            17. The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse by Aesop Now you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a visit to his cousin in the country. He was rough and ready, this cousin, but he loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome. Beans and bacon, cheese, and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely. The Town Mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare and said: 'I cannot understand, Cousin, how you can put up with such poor food as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the country; come you with me and I will show you how to live. When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life.' Not sooner said than done: the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night. You will want some refreshment after our long journey,' said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room. There they found the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes, and all that was nice Suddenly they heard growling and barking. ' What is that?' said the country mouse. : It is only the dogs of the house' answered the other. ' Only!' said the Country mouse. ' I do not like that music at my dinner'. Just at that moment,nthe door Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper down and runoff. ' Good-bye, Cousin,' said the country mouse, 'What! going so soon?' said the other. ' Yes' he replied, ' better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fearQuestion:1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The characters in the story are the Town Mouse and the Country Mouse.</p><p></p><p>2. The Town Mouse is described as rough and ready, with a love for finer things in life. He is also portrayed as being somewhat condescending towards his cousin's simple country life. The Country Mouse, on the other hand, is hospitable and generous, offering his humble food freely to his cousin.</p><p></p><p>3. It can be argued that neither character is a hero or a villain in the story. The Town Mouse is not necessarily a villain, as he did not have any malicious intent towards his cousin. Instead, he was trying to be helpful and show his cousin a better way of life. Similarly, the Country Mouse is not necessarily a hero, as he did not face any significant challenges or overcome any obstacles. Instead, he was a gracious host to his cousin. </p><p></p><p>4. The story has two settings - the countryside, where the Country Mouse lives, and the town, where the Town Mouse resides.</p><br />
