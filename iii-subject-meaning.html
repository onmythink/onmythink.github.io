1. Expected Output:
At the end of the semester, you are required to submit a creative journal portfolio. This will include an introduction, a
synthesis, a creative presentation, and a conclusion of all your learning experiences from the course CFE 101. This
final output is non-negotiable; thus, make sure to submit one.
II. Rationale:
This course requirement is an assessment of what you have learned as exemplified by your creativity as well as your
critical and reflective thinking skills. The portfolio summarizes your journey with God as the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit. As a Louisian, you are expected to become a living witness of the Christian faith by pondering through all
the lessons taken during this course and drawing insights from the wise. Also, by sharing your experiences, learnings,
and ideas you are contributing to the formation and transformation of the Christian community as a whole.
III. Parts and Sequence of the Portfolio:
A. Cover/ Title Page (be creative)
B. Introduction
This includes the following:
a. A brief introduction about yourself.
b. A brief summary of your learnings from the subject.
Note: In summarizing, this will allow you to express your experiences and learnings as you journey with God through
this course.
C. Content:
Instruction: Be creative in the presentation of your experiences, reflections, and realizations. Being creative refers to
the use of a digital or hand-drawn artwork or a poem or a song, and the like. You are therefore expected to place/attach four (4) creative outputs each assigned to capture the four (4) modules of this course. Place a brief discussion about
the meaning of each creative output.
The following are questions for your guide:
a. In what ways did God journey with you through this course?
b. As you journeyed with Him, how can you express this journey through a creative form?
c. Does this creative form portray your experiences, reflections, and realizations from this journey?
D. Conclusion:
Instruction: State and briefly express the relevance of CFE 101 in your day-to-day life and on faith.</a>

1. Expected Output:
At the end of the semester, you are required to submit a creative journal portfolio. This will include an introduction, a
synthesis, a creative presentation, and a conclusion of all your learning experiences from the course CFE 101. This
final output is non-negotiable; thus, make sure to submit one.
II. Rationale:
This course requirement is an assessment of what you have learned as exemplified by your creativity as well as your
critical and reflective thinking skills. The portfolio summarizes your journey with God as the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit. As a Louisian, you are expected to become a living witness of the Christian faith by pondering through all
the lessons taken during this course and drawing insights from the wise. Also, by sharing your experiences, learnings,
and ideas you are contributing to the formation and transformation of the Christian community as a whole.
III. Parts and Sequence of the Portfolio:
A. Cover/ Title Page (be creative)
B. Introduction
This includes the following:
a. A brief introduction about yourself.
b. A brief summary of your learnings from the subject.
Note: In summarizing, this will allow you to express your experiences and learnings as you journey with God through
this course.
C. Content:
Instruction: Be creative in the presentation of your experiences, reflections, and realizations. Being creative refers to
the use of a digital or hand-drawn artwork or a poem or a song, and the like. You are therefore expected to place/attach four (4) creative outputs each assigned to capture the four (4) modules of this course. Place a brief discussion about
the meaning of each creative output.
The following are questions for your guide:
a. In what ways did God journey with you through this course?
b. As you journeyed with Him, how can you express this journey through a creative form?
c. Does this creative form portray your experiences, reflections, and realizations from this journey?
D. Conclusion:

Introduction</strong></p>I'm Sam, a senior at Ateneo de Manila University and a high school student. I've been studying too arduously. Since first semester, I've been on the dean's list. The stories of God's ongoing journey with His people are covered in CFE 101. The biblical tales will act as a source of inspiration and a road map for realizing God's boundless and unwavering love for people and the entire world. In regards to my trust in our Creator and Savior, I have grown significantly. I can trust him because of his example and teachings.<p></p><p><strong>C. Content</strong></p>It enables the pupils to understand and appreciate God's initiative in interfering in human history to guide people back to the correct path and prevent them from making the same mistakes as their forefathers.Jesus is significant to us because He empowers us to transform our lives, face challenges, and advance in faith as we make our way back to Him and His Father through His Atonement, teachings, hope, peace, and example.<p></p><p><strong>D. Conclusion</strong></p>In times of weakness, darkness can aid us by giving us power. We have no value without faith. Faith is the same as trust. You must have complete faith in God's protection, knowing that he will look out for you and provide for your needs. He knows what is best, but in order to fully accept what he has in store for you, you must have complete faith in him. Our faith is not irrational since our God is dependable and just.<p></p><p></p><p>Portfolio about creative writing:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17897593</p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
