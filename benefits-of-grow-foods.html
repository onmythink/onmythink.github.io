It is a form of asexual reproduction in which a new organismsdevelop from an outgrowth called bud that grows in a specific sitein the body of a matured or older species6. It is a form of asexual reproductionwhere an egg develops into acomplete individual without being fertilized.7.This pertains to the factors in the environment that affects theweather. These factors include light, temperature, water and wind.8. These are organisms that can produce their own food usingmaterials from inorganic sources.9. It is defined as a network of interconnected food chains so as toform a numberof feeding relationships amongst different organismof a biotic community.10. It is a close relationship between two species in which at least one species benefits.11. This is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other species is not affected.12. It is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit.13. These are different stages of feeding position in a food chain such as primary producers and consumers of different types.14. These are called producers because they produce their own food through photosynthesis15. This is an organism that cannot manufacture its own food by carbon fixation and therefore derives its intake of nutrition from othersources of organic carbon, mainly plant or animal matter.please need asap​</a>

What order of consumer is the heron?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Mangroves are the only trees that are capable of thriving in salt water. They form unique intertidal forests at the edge of land and sea, see Fig. They are represented on all continents with tropical and subtropical coasts, i.e. North and South America, Africa and Middle-East, Asia and Oceania</p><p></p><p>2.Requirements for the development of mangroves are:</p><p>*Average temperatures of the coldest month higher than 20°C; the seasonal temperature range should not exceed 5°C. ...</p><p></p><p>*A fine-grained substrate. ...</p><p></p><p>*Shores must be free of strong wave action and strong tidal currents.</p><p></p><p>*Saline water; they are facultative halophytes.</p><p></p><p>3.Mangroves protect shorelines from damaging storm and hurricane winds, waves, and floods. Mangroves also help prevent erosion by stabilizing sediments with their tangled root systems. They maintain water quality and clarity, filtering pollutants and trapping sediments originating from land.</p><p></p><p>4.Mangroves are inhabited by a variety of benthic inverte- brates, such as brachyuran crabs, gastropods, bivalves, hermit crabs, barnacles, sponges, tunicates, polychaetes and sipuncu- lids. Mangrove invertebrates often show marked zonation patterns, and colonise a variety of specific micro-environments.</p><p></p><p>7.They have something like a strainer that collects whatever is floating in the water as they swim. Some of this is plant stuff and some is animal stuff, so shrimp are omnivores. Sometimes they act as primary consumers (when they eat plants) and sometimes as secondary consumers (when they eat animals).v</p><p></p><p>8.Third-level consumers are any organisms big enough to obtain energy by feeding off lower-level consumers. These are also called tertiary consumers. For example, in a forest ecosystem, snakes eat toads. Heron and large fish, such as bass and walleye, consume smaller fish, frogs and crayfish.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sorry po diko alam answer yung 5&amp;6</p><br />
