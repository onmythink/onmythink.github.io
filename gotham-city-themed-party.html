                                            CELL CITY ANALOGY 	In a faraway city called Gotham City, the main export and production product is the cellular gadget. Everyone in the city has something to do with the cellular gadget making and the entire town is designed to build and export gadgets. The city hall has the instruction for gadget making. Gadgets come in all shapes and sizes and any citizen of Gotham City can get the instructions and begin their own gadgets. Gadgets are generally produced in small stores around the city. These small stores can be built by the construction engineer’s union (whose headquarters are in the city hall). After the gadget is constructed, they are placed on special carts which can deliver the gadget anywhere in the city. In order for a gadget to be exported, the carts take the gadget to the postal office, where the gadgets are packaged and labeled for export. Sometimes gadgets don’t turn out right, and the rejects are turned to the scrap yard where they are broken down for parts or destroyed altogether. The city powers the gadget shops and carts from hydraulic dam. The entire city is enclosed by a large wooden fence. Only the postal trucks and citizens with proper documents are allowed inside the city. 1.	Nucleus – _____________________ 2.	Nucleolus - ____________________ 3.	Mitochondria – _________________ 4.

Both Superman and Batman are heroes, but only one is truly a superhero, and taking into account their upbringing, motives, and criminal targets, that is Batman. Upbringing was not gentle for either. Superman came from Krypton, a planet that was about to self-destruct. His parents sent him as a baby on a spaceship to Earth. There he would be adopted by an ordinary farm family. His adoptive parents named him Clark Kent and reared him well. In the same generation, far away in Gotham, Bruce Wayne, the future Batman, was born to a contented, wealthy family. Tragically, his parents were killed in his presence during a mugging. He inherited the family wealth and was raised by his kindly butler. Those very different backgrounds provided Superman and Batman with powerful but different motives for fighting crime. Superman was programmed in his space capsule to know about the forces of good and evil on Earth and to fight the bad people. Unlike Superman, Batman learned from experience. Both have gone on to fight many bad people, but each one has a special enemy. For Superman, it is Luthor, who has studied Superman and knows all about him, even his outstanding weakness-the mineral Kryptonite. For Batman, it is the Joker, who, as a wicked teenager, was the mugger-murderer of his parents.

                        Cannot be determined. Note that the given percentage, that is, 7.5% refers to the pizza orders, and that the given number of pizza restaurants in Gotham which is 100. These data is not sufficient to solve for the exact number of Gotham restaurants that have Hawaiian pizzas on their menus. Since the answer could be all the 100 restaurants can offer Hawaiian pizza and the 7.5% of pizza could come from these 100 restaurants in different amounts; it could also be that the 7.5% of the pizza orders comes from only one restaurant that offers the best Hawaiian pizza in Gotham; and it might also be that the 7.5% orders comes from only best 3 of the restaurants that offer Hawaiian pizza in their menus. <br />

Both Superman and Batman are heroes, but only one is truly a superhero, and taking into account their upbringing, motives, and criminal targets, that is Batman. Upbringing was not gentle for either. Superman came from Krypton, a planet that was about to self-destruct. His parents sent him as a baby on a spaceship to Earth. There he would be adopted by an ordinary farm family. His adoptive parents named him Clark Kent and reared him well. In the same generation, far away in Gotham, Bruce Wayne, the future Batman, was born to a contented, wealthy family. Tragically, his parents were killed in his presence during a mugging. He inherited the family wealth and was raised by his kindly butler. Those very different backgrounds provided Superman and Batman with powerful but different motives for fighting crime. Superman was programmed in his space capsule to know about the forces of good and evil on Earth and to fight the bad people. Unlike Superman, Batman learned from experience. Both have gone on to fight many bad people, but each one has a special enemy. For Superman, it is Luthor, who has studied Superman and knows all about him, even his outstanding weakness-the mineral Kryptonite. For Batman, it is the Joker, who, as a wicked teenager, was the mugger-murderer of his parents. Many spectacular battles have ensued for both crime fighters, and one has reached the top in his profession. Superman offers overwhelming physical strength against crime, but Batman displays cunning and base passion. As he strikes fear in the hearts of the wicked, he's not just winning, he is getting even.
