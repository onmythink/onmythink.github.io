                                            Securitas Finance and Insurance Corporation (SFIC) was, by all accounts, a model insurance company. Profits were strong and had been for several years in a row. The company carried the highest ratings in its industry, and it had recently been voted one of the Top 100 companies to work for in the Philippines in recognition of its "very employee-focused work environment". SFIC offers very generous benefits: free lunches in the cafeteria, on-site daycare facilities, and even free Starbucks Coffee in the employee break rooms. In an industry that was still struggling with the massive claims after a succession of typhoons and floods in the Philippines, SFIC was financially stable and positioned to become one of the major insurance companies in the country. So, why were the CEO, Juan Paderez; the CFO, Lydia Sanchez, and the COO, Jose Aquino, all fired on the same day with no explanation other than that the terminations were related to issues of conduct?​</a>

                                            Philippines is a semifeudal nation. Big business landlords and elites exploit the natural resources and the cheap serf-like labor of the country. This results in the displacement of families who then migrate to urban areas or to other countries to find a better living. It makes me wonder why the Canadian government only allows one family member to come to Canada if they need more people here. The Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP) is a program of the federal government allowing Canadians to import temporary migrant live-in caregivers, known around the world as domestic workers. If they complete the program, they can become Canadian citizens and sponsor their family through the reunification program. This takes an average of seven years, sometimes more. That’s a long time to be separated from your family. A long time spent taking care of the children of others, while your own need you at home. This aspect of the program causes damage to family relationships, one that affects the children deeply—this I can tell you from personal experience. Canadians need to be aware that we are part of this system. Not only here in Canada through our immigration policies, but also in the Philippines where Canadian imperialism contributes to forcedmigration. Part of our taxes goes to fund Canadian companies in the Philippines (especially in the mining sector), and Canadian military training of the Philippine armed forces to help protect those companies and forcefully displace Filipinos from the countryside through militarization. I want a Philippines with true democracy and true independence. I want justice for the marginalized and underrepresented. Today I am the Chairperson of Anakbayan-Toronto. We advocate for human rights, and we struggle for national industrialization that will keep Filipino families intact and ensure that no one will have to leave the country for a better life. I don’t want any child to suffer what I went through. Anakbayan-Toronto will not stop calling for national industrialization and genuine land reform in the Philippines, this is the only way that Filipinos will be able to work decent jobs, and not have to leave the country.1.

2. Choose a company within the tourism or hospitality industry in the Philippines and explain how it uses its distribution strategy to attract customers to its product.</h2><br />
                        <p>1. The distribution system for the tourism and hospitality industry is different from that of other industries because it typically involves the use of intermediaries such as travel agents, tour operators, and online booking platforms to reach customers. These intermediaries are responsible for marketing and selling the products and services offered by the tourism and hospitality industry, whereas other industries may use direct sales or distribution channels.</p><p></p><p>2. One example of a company within the tourism and hospitality industry in the Philippines that uses its distribution strategy to attract customers is the hotel chain Ayala Land Hotels and Resorts. Ayala Land Hotels and Resorts uses a combination of direct and indirect distribution channels to reach its customers. For example, the company operates its own website and booking platform, allowing customers to book directly with the hotel chain. In addition, the company partners with online travel agencies and tour operators to increase its visibility and reach a wider audience. Ayala Land Hotels and Resorts also uses social media and other digital marketing channels to promote its products and services and attract customers.</p><p></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Greetings, mortal.

                            6. Securitas Finance and Insurance Corporation (SFIC) was, by all accounts, a model insurance company. Profits were strong and had been for several years in a row. The company carried the highest ratings in its industry, and it had recently been voted one of the Top 100 companies to work for in the Philippines in recognition of its "very employee-focused work environment". SFIC offers very generous benefits: free lunches in the cafeteria, on-site daycare facilities, and even free Starbucks Coffee in the employee break rooms. In an industry that was still struggling with the massive claims after a succession of typhoons and floods in the Philippines, SFIC was financially stable and positioned to become one of the major insurance companies in the country. So, why were the CEO, Juan Paderez; the CFO, Lydia Sanchez, and the COO, Jose Aquino, all fired on the same day with no explanation other than that the terminations were related to issues of conduct?​</h2><br />

                            9. Many foreign companies have decided to offshore some of their processes to BPO companies in the Philippines. You have learned about the upside and downside of offshoring for both the clients and service provider. As somebody who is either working or intending to work in the IT-BPM industry, what are the opportunities and challenges in working in an offshore location (Philippines) but still provide service to a major international company based abroad?</h2><br />
                        Opportunities of Offshoring<p><strong>1. economies of scale</strong></p><p>When a business opens an office or a factory overseas, it is not only taking advantage of lower labor costs but also of scale efficiencies already in place. Rent, Internet access, and other cost factors may be cheaper in the host nation than in the place of origin.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. close collaboration</strong></p><p>Offshoring allows for closer physical collaboration, which provides the business more control. The benefit of shared space collaboration is that it allows for supervision of work without the filters or delays brought on by technology.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. favorable government policies</strong></p><p>Some countries offer corporations that invest in their economies unique privileges and incentives. These include tax breaks and easy access to finance, both of which could boost a company's bottom line. Exploring such cash flow improvements can significantly improve the upfront cost of outsourcing core functions.</p><p></p>Challenges of Offshoring<p><strong>1. increase unemployment</strong></p><p>The main complaint against businesses that outsource is that it raises unemployment in the local economy.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. cultural and social differences</strong></p><p>The client will become fully absorbed in the host nation's culture and social customs. Communication and productivity may be impacted by this. Time zone variations, in contrast to outsourcing, may act against the offshoring company because output may be delayed as a result of changes in workforce availability. This may increase unintentional costs for some organizations and job activities.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. security issues</strong></p><p>You run the risk of security lapses and data integrity compromises whenever you provide data to another entity. Even while working in a shared area, there will inevitably be data transfer problems. Sending sensitive data between two locations can still be risky, even if an offshore expansion is nominally a part of the parent firm.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about offshoring, just click the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9998218</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/5718150</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/10624639</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                        <p>1. One of the notable roles of the private sector in tourism planning and development is its ability to invest time and money into aspects such as marketing and training. This can help to promote the destination overall and can also help to up-skill staff in the local area.</p><p>2. The definition of traditional is something that is in keeping with long-standing tradition, style or custom. An example of traditional is the practice of eating turkey as the traditional or accepted Thanksgiving meal. An example of traditional is a formal style of furniture that doesn't change with fads or the seasons.</p><p></p><p>Travelers are shifting to private properties instead of crowded hotels and resorts. Many prefer driving to flying and have returned to using travel advisors and trip insurance. As the industry is relentlessly transforming, businesses need to follow emerging trends to stay afloat.</p><p></p><p>Similarities: Tour wholesalers operate in a very similar way to wholesalers in other industries. ... A tour wholesaler supplies to retail travel agents, they DO NOT sell directly to consumers. Wholesalers link individual tourism operators with retailers.</p><p></p><p>3. According to Skift, U.S. and foreign carriers flew more than 895 million passengers through U.S. airports in 2015 – a new record. Millions of people, both business and personal travelers, used online services to manage the sometimes-complicated travel booking and reservation system, many of them enlisting the services of a travel agency.</p><p></p><p>4.

                            18. Philippines is a semifeudal nation. Big business landlords and elites exploit the natural resources and the cheap serf-like labor of the country. This results in the displacement of families who then migrate to urban areas or to other countries to find a better living. It makes me wonder why the Canadian government only allows one family member to come to Canada if they need more people here. The Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP) is a program of the federal government allowing Canadians to import temporary migrant live-in caregivers, known around the world as domestic workers. If they complete the program, they can become Canadian citizens and sponsor their family through the reunification program. This takes an average of seven years, sometimes more. That’s a long time to be separated from your family. A long time spent taking care of the children of others, while your own need you at home. This aspect of the program causes damage to family relationships, one that affects the children deeply—this I can tell you from personal experience. Canadians need to be aware that we are part of this system. Not only here in Canada through our immigration policies, but also in the Philippines where Canadian imperialism contributes to forcedmigration. Part of our taxes goes to fund Canadian companies in the Philippines (especially in the mining sector), and Canadian military training of the Philippine armed forces to help protect those companies and forcefully displace Filipinos from the countryside through militarization. I want a Philippines with true democracy and true independence. I want justice for the marginalized and underrepresented. Today I am the Chairperson of Anakbayan-Toronto. We advocate for human rights, and we struggle for national industrialization that will keep Filipino families intact and ensure that no one will have to leave the country for a better life. I don’t want any child to suffer what I went through. Anakbayan-Toronto will not stop calling for national industrialization and genuine land reform in the Philippines, this is the only way that Filipinos will be able to work decent jobs, and not have to leave the country.1.
