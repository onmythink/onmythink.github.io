⇔ "so" is a conjunction used to connect the reason, solution, and explanation.#CarryOnLearning<p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>so<p>It is quite noisy at home, <strong>so</strong> I finish my homework in the library after classes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Let's understand what CONJUNCTIONS are!<strong>Conjunctions</strong> are a part of speech that link and connect words, phrases, and clauses in a sentence.Conjunctions help with the <strong>overall flow</strong> of a sentence as it helps add more detail and thought to it.There are three (3) kinds of conjunctions: <strong>coordinating</strong>, <strong>subordinating</strong>, and <strong>correlative</strong>.Example: Cassandra made some food <strong>because</strong> she was hungry.  &amp;  <strong>Although</strong> times are rough, we must fight hard and stay strong.<p></p>Lets's understand the COORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS!<strong>Coordinating conjunctions</strong> connect two independent clauses.These kinds of conjunctions use the FANBOYS- <strong>for</strong>, <strong>and</strong>, <strong>nor</strong>, <strong>but</strong>, <strong>or</strong>, <strong>yet</strong>, and <strong>so</strong>.If we observe the sentence above "It is quite noisy at home, so I finish my homework in the library after classes.", we can see that the underlined group of words are <strong>independent clauses</strong>.REMEMBER! Add a comma before the coordinating conjunction.Example: Mike prepared a gift for Norton, <strong>for</strong> it was his birthday.<p></p>Let's understand the Coord. Conjuction "so"!"<strong>so</strong>" as a coordinating conjunction is used to show results or decisions.If we observe the sentence above "It is quite noisy at home, so I finish my homework in the library after classes.", we can see that 'so' introduced finishing homework at the library as a <strong>result/decision</strong> <strong>of the noise at home</strong>.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>———— /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\ ————</p><p>   additional links !</p><p>More on Coordinating Conjunctions - brainly.ph/question/223100</p><p>Conjunctions and It's Kinds - https://brainly.in/question/1241501</p><p></p><p></p><p>⚘ ᵏⁱᵗʰᵃⁿᵈʷᵃ</p><br />
