The Renaissance's grandest, most highly valued works of vocal music were polyphonic settings of the Ordinary of the Mass'. The Ordinary Mass is composed of five texts --Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei (the first words of the texts) that were included in every Mass, not only in Masses that celebrated special occasions. The Baroque era of Western classical music is usually defined as the period from 1600 to 1750. Two stylistic tendencies that partially define the Baroque where there is an increased interest in the solo voice and a rise in the status of instruments and instrumental music.

                                            The Little Albert Experiment Directions: Describe the ethical codes and policies that are violated in the video presented. Write you answer in 5-10 sentences only.The Little Albert Experiment was a famous psychology experiment conducted by behaviorist John B. Watson. The goal of the experiment was to show empirical evidence of classical conditioning in humans. For this study he chose a nine-month old infant from a hospital referred to as "Albert" for the experiment. The participant in the experiment was a child that Watson and Rayner called "Albert B." but is known popularly today as Little Albert. He was exposed to a series of stimuli including a white rat, a rabbit, a monkey, masks, and burning newspapers and observed the boy's reactions.Little Albert initially showed no fear of any of the objects he was shown.The next time Albert was exposed to the rat, Watson made a loud noise by hitting a metal pipe with a hammer. Naturally, the child began to cry after hearing the loud noise. After repeatedly pairing the white rat with the loud noise, Albert began to expect a frightening noise whenever he saw the white rate. Soon, Albert began to cry simply after seeing the rat. The Little Albert experiment presents an example of how classical conditioning can be used to condition an emotional response. After conditioning, Albert feared not just the white rat, but a wide variety of similar white objects as well. His fear included other furry objects including a fur coat and Watson wearing a Santa Claus beard.Question: What ethical codes and participant's rights were violated in the experiment? What could have been the ethical considerations in doing the experiment?​</a>

                            29. The Little Albert Experiment Directions: Describe the ethical codes and policies that are violated in the video presented. Write you answer in 5-10 sentences only.The Little Albert Experiment was a famous psychology experiment conducted by behaviorist John B. Watson. The goal of the experiment was to show empirical evidence of classical conditioning in humans. For this study he chose a nine-month old infant from a hospital referred to as "Albert" for the experiment. The participant in the experiment was a child that Watson and Rayner called "Albert B." but is known popularly today as Little Albert. He was exposed to a series of stimuli including a white rat, a rabbit, a monkey, masks, and burning newspapers and observed the boy's reactions.Little Albert initially showed no fear of any of the objects he was shown.The next time Albert was exposed to the rat, Watson made a loud noise by hitting a metal pipe with a hammer. Naturally, the child began to cry after hearing the loud noise. After repeatedly pairing the white rat with the loud noise, Albert began to expect a frightening noise whenever he saw the white rate. Soon, Albert began to cry simply after seeing the rat. The Little Albert experiment presents an example of how classical conditioning can be used to condition an emotional response. After conditioning, Albert feared not just the white rat, but a wide variety of similar white objects as well. His fear included other furry objects including a fur coat and Watson wearing a Santa Claus beard.Question: What ethical codes and participant's rights were violated in the experiment? What could have been the ethical considerations in doing the experiment?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Little Albert experiment violated ethical codes and participant's rights by using a nine-month-old infant without informed consent, causing undue harm, lacking beneficence, violating confidentiality, and lacking transparency. Ethical considerations could have included obtaining informed consent, minimizing potential harm, ensuring confidentiality, providing potential benefits, and conducting a debriefing session.</p><br />
