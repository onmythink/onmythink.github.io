                                            A vaccine is a biological substance designed to protect humans from infections caused by bacteria and viruses. It works by training the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens, either viruses or bacteria. 
Though no vaccine is 100% effective, many come quite close. For instance, two doses of the chickenpox vaccine are 98% effective against any form of chickenpox. In fact, many vaccines against deadly diseases – such as smallpox, yellow fever, measles are over 95% effective, as long as they are administered on schedule. History has also attested to the effectiveness of vaccines. 
However, there was also an issue in our country about Dengvaxia indicated for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus. The Department of Health suspended a school-based vaccine program utilizing French drug maker Sanofi Pasteur’s Dengvaxia vaccine due to a number of deaths from various complications that allegedly attributed to the vaccine product. By August 2019, over 600 people, mostly children, who received the vaccine have died. It must be emphasized that not all of these deaths are due to the vaccine itself. Regardless, the DOH banned the vaccine’s sale or use in the Philippines. 
Now, thinking of our current situation, if a vaccine for Corona virus should be available, would you consider taking the vaccine? Why or why not? Do you think that the government should have a mandatory law for every one to get vaccinated for the protection of the community or should it be a choice to the individual? Justify your answer.
