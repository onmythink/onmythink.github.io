                                            Pavia is a small town, covering only 3,804 hectares of prime farmland. It is close to the provincial capital of Iloilo, a short 15-minute drive from the City proper. Historically, it has alternatively been part of Santa Barbara, and an arabal of Jaro. The geography of the town is flat, and the fertile soil makes it ideal for planting rice, coconuts and other fruit trees. However, the 19th-century Augustinian friars working in Iloilo noted in their histories that most of the residents worked primarily as entrepreneurs. This was probably due to the proximity of Pavia to the City. But this proximity was also a mixed blessing, as it caused many of the residents to fall prey to the usurious moneylenders from Jaro. Pavia was officially founded in 1862. How the town got its name is unclear, and has long been disputed. One theory has it that the name came from a certain Colonel Pavia of the Spanish garrison in Iloilo who was supposedly responsible for initially establishing a Spanish presence in the area. Others believe that the name is a Spanish corruption of the Hiligaynon word biya-biya, as the area was originally considered a neglected patch of land that served mostly as a camping ground for city sophisticates and absentee landlords. Others claim that the town was named after a Spanish governor-general, Manuel Pavia y Lay, Marquis of Novaliches, who eventually became a priest after his short tenure in the Philippines from 1853-1854. However, this author believes that the more credible theory seems to be the overlooked fact that the town's religious well-being was placed under the jurisdiction and supervision of the friars of the Augustinian Order, and they simply named the place in honor of the town in Pavia, Italy, where the founder of their order, Saint Augustine, was buried. The last theory seems to be supported by circumstantial historical evidence: it was also in 1862 that an independent parish dedicated to Saint Monica was established by an Augustinian friar, Policarpio Minayo. But it was only in 1889 when construction of the famous brick church -- as it now stands -- began. It was envisioned and built in the Byzantine style, with Romanesque design elements. Two Greek crosses dominate the facade, and the transept is round set against the rear wall. It is unique in the whole of Panay Island, as it is the only church built entirely of red brick, inside and out. Quite significantly, the church design was apparently inspired by the ancient royal archbasilica of San Michele Maggiore in Pavia, Italy -- minus the front columns.* ** Its alternative history, however, has it that 13 large landowners were actually the town's founding fathers 14 years earlier, in 1848: Marcos Evangelista, Graciano Gonzaga, Constantino Gumban, Vicente Hechanova, Anacleto Hedriana, Jorge Jagolino, Locario Juntanilla, Barbario Maquiling, and the brothers Ramos, Remigio, Leocadio, Gregori and Mariano Maquiling. In their honor, streets around the town plaza were named after them. It was said that the landholdings of each of these founding fathers "stretched as far as the eyes could see" -- although these properties were perhaps more realistically measured in sizes that ranged from 100 to 300 hectares only. Much of the original families' patrimonies, though, have been diluted through the decades and contributed to their decline. But only the Gumban have maintained a dominating political presence in the town for most of the 20th century.

During this time, the Spaniards used paintings as religious propaganda to spread Catholicism throughout the Philippines. During the Spanish regime, Filipinos had mastered the use of different propaganda techniques which was discussed in the previous lesson. A. The Spaniards exploited the glittering Catholicism faith to conceal a darker motive that is, securing Spanish control and acquisition of the spice trade.

The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the farmer’s beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain. He said he would forgo the farmer’s debt if he could marry his daughter. Both the farmer and his daughter were horrified by the proposal. So the cunning money-lender suggested that they let providence decide the matter. He told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty money bag. Then the girl would have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become his wife and her father’s debt would be forgiven. If she picked the white pebble she need not marry him and her father’s debt would still be forgiven. If she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail. They were standing on a pebble strewn path in the farmer’s field. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. As he picked them up, the sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. Now, imagine that you were standing in the field. What would you have done if you were the girl? If you had to advise her, what would you have told her? Take a moment to ponder this. What would you recommend that the girl do? The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles. “Oh, how clumsy of me!” she said. “But never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.” The moneylender dared not admit his dishonesty. The girl changed what seemed an impossible situation into an extremely advantageous one.​</a>

                            12. Pavia is a small town, covering only 3,804 hectares of prime farmland. It is close to the provincial capital of Iloilo, a short 15-minute drive from the City proper. Historically, it has alternatively been part of Santa Barbara, and an arabal of Jaro. The geography of the town is flat, and the fertile soil makes it ideal for planting rice, coconuts and other fruit trees. However, the 19th-century Augustinian friars working in Iloilo noted in their histories that most of the residents worked primarily as entrepreneurs. This was probably due to the proximity of Pavia to the City. But this proximity was also a mixed blessing, as it caused many of the residents to fall prey to the usurious moneylenders from Jaro. Pavia was officially founded in 1862. How the town got its name is unclear, and has long been disputed. One theory has it that the name came from a certain Colonel Pavia of the Spanish garrison in Iloilo who was supposedly responsible for initially establishing a Spanish presence in the area. Others believe that the name is a Spanish corruption of the Hiligaynon word biya-biya, as the area was originally considered a neglected patch of land that served mostly as a camping ground for city sophisticates and absentee landlords. Others claim that the town was named after a Spanish governor-general, Manuel Pavia y Lay, Marquis of Novaliches, who eventually became a priest after his short tenure in the Philippines from 1853-1854. However, this author believes that the more credible theory seems to be the overlooked fact that the town's religious well-being was placed under the jurisdiction and supervision of the friars of the Augustinian Order, and they simply named the place in honor of the town in Pavia, Italy, where the founder of their order, Saint Augustine, was buried. The last theory seems to be supported by circumstantial historical evidence: it was also in 1862 that an independent parish dedicated to Saint Monica was established by an Augustinian friar, Policarpio Minayo. But it was only in 1889 when construction of the famous brick church -- as it now stands -- began. It was envisioned and built in the Byzantine style, with Romanesque design elements. Two Greek crosses dominate the facade, and the transept is round set against the rear wall. It is unique in the whole of Panay Island, as it is the only church built entirely of red brick, inside and out. Quite significantly, the church design was apparently inspired by the ancient royal archbasilica of San Michele Maggiore in Pavia, Italy -- minus the front columns.* ** Its alternative history, however, has it that 13 large landowners were actually the town's founding fathers 14 years earlier, in 1848: Marcos Evangelista, Graciano Gonzaga, Constantino Gumban, Vicente Hechanova, Anacleto Hedriana, Jorge Jagolino, Locario Juntanilla, Barbario Maquiling, and the brothers Ramos, Remigio, Leocadio, Gregori and Mariano Maquiling. In their honor, streets around the town plaza were named after them. It was said that the landholdings of each of these founding fathers "stretched as far as the eyes could see" -- although these properties were perhaps more realistically measured in sizes that ranged from 100 to 300 hectares only. Much of the original families' patrimonies, though, have been diluted through the decades and contributed to their decline. But only the Gumban have maintained a dominating political presence in the town for most of the 20th century.

I need the plot (introduction,rising action, climax, falling action, denounment) settings, theme, charactersof the story belowMany years ago in a small Indian village, a farmer had the misfortune of owing a large sum of money to a village moneylender. The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the farmer’s beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain. He said he would forgo the farmer’s debt if he could marry his daughter. Both the farmer and his daughter were horrified by the proposal. So the cunning money-lender suggested that they let providence decide the matter. He told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty money bag. Then the girl would have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become his wife and her father’s debt would be forgiven. If she picked the white pebble she need not marry him and her father’s debt would still be forgiven. If she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail. They were standing on a pebble strewn path in the farmer’s field. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. As he picked them up, the sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. Now, imagine that you were standing in the field. What would you have done if you were the girl? If you had to advise her, what would you have told her? Take a moment to ponder this. What would you recommend that the girl do? The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles. “Oh, how clumsy of me!” she said. “But never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.” The moneylender dared not admit his dishonesty. The girl changed what seemed an impossible situation into an extremely advantageous one.​</h2><br />
