                                            can you find the main idea of the statement below:The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global economic slowdown. But there are debates on why economic growth has not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest. Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to make economic growth truly inclusive. This policy note examines trends in official (monetary) poverty statistics. It also looks into why poverty reduction has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country. It pointrd out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more likely slide into poverty. This suggests that government should not onlu br concerned with the poor, but should also have policy instruments to assist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.​​pls answer it for research purpose thank you​</a>

                                            -Pa summarize poThe Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest. Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks. ​</a>

                                            The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global economicslowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has not translated into povertyreduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean newopportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with therest. Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to capital are morelikely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to make economic growth truly inclusive.This Policy Note examines trends in official (monetary) poverty statistics. It also investigateswhy poverty reduction has been historically lack lustre in the Philippines using available panel datathat provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country. Itpointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more likely to experience higher incomegrowth, but some non-poor have also been vulnerable to slide into poverty. This suggests thatgovernment should not only be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments toassist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.1) what is the main idea of the text?2) does the text provide supporting details? cite two details.3) does the text provide credible detail? explain briefly.4) does the text have any relevance to you? in what way?5) do you agree with the author's idea? explain briefly.​</a>

                            12. -Pa summarize poThe Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest. Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks. ​</h2><br />

But there are people who wonder why economic growth has not translated into povertyreduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean newopportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with therest. Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to capital are morelikely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to make economic growth truly inclusive.This Policy Note examines trends in official (monetary) poverty statistics. It also investigateswhy poverty reduction has been historically lack lustre in the Philippines using available panel datathat provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country.

This suggests thatgovernment should not only be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments toassist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.1) what is the main idea of the text?2) does the text provide supporting details? cite two details.3) does the text provide credible detail? explain briefly.4) does the text have any relevance to you? in what way?5) do you agree with the author's idea? explain briefly.​</h2><br />
