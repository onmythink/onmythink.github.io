                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. What do you think is your chosen song about?</strong></p><p>The song appears to be about the struggles and challenges one goes through after a break-up. The lyrics convey the pain and longing the singer feels towards their ex-partner and express their struggles in moving on from the relationship. The lyrics mention being unable to sleep and the memories of the past not fading, and being told to "just snap" to get over the person, as well as frustration over the difficulty of moving on and the unhelpful advice of others.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Which words or phrases helped you understand the context of your chosen song? Explain your answer.</strong></p><p>Some words and phrases that give context to the song include "Wishing these memories would fade," "As if it was really that easy for me to get over you," "I just need time," "Since June twenty-second, my heart's been on fire" and "Get out of my heart, 'cause I might snap." These phrases give the impression that the singer is struggling to move on from a past relationship, and they indicate that the process is difficult, and that they are aware that snapping fingers isn't going to make the pain go away.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. How will you rate your familiarity of the context of your chosen song using a scale of 1 being the lowest to 10 as the highest?</strong></p><p>I would rate my familiarity with the context of the song a 10. As someone who has gone through a difficult break-up, I understand the pain and struggles expressed in the lyrics and can relate to them personally.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Do you know of real-life scenarios or stories that you can relate to your chosen song? Cite at least one and explain how it relates to your chosen song.</strong></p><p>I have experienced a situation in my life where I had to go through a break-up. The feeling of not being able to move on and the memories that I still hold on to, the feeling of being told to 'just snap' and move on, and the frustration of not being able to put the feeling to an end. I can relate to the song as it reflects my own personal experience.<br /><br /><br /><br />Correct me if im wrong thanks! </p><br />
