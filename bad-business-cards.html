                                            Yam and his brother sam
It was the 30th of March when Sam was born. After a week in the hospital, Mother and Sam were home. Yam, the eldest son, was excited. At last he has a baby brother! He will tell
his classmates about the good news. At first, life at home was full of happiness but little by little Yam felt something strange in himself. He was jealous of his baby brother because all their attention was always focused
on Sam. After a month, Mommy went back to work in the office, Baby Sam was left in Grandmother's care, while Yam attended his modular class at home since the pandemic, he spent most of his time playing games with his gadget. His mini /pad was his best friend. He
never bothered to look after his baby brother.
It was always like that when Yam was at home. He always played with his gadget. Mom was busy, Daddy was busy, Lola was busy with Sam. He thinks nobody cares, so he
might as well enjoy his freedom! One day, the teacher talked to his parents during the issuance of the report card. The teacher told them that Yam often submitted his modules without answers on the activities. His tests were also failed. His parents talked to him and was reprimanded about his overuse of
gadgets. His parents threatened him that they will confiscate his pad if he will not study hard.
Yam promised them that he will do better in his studies. Little did his parents know, Yam did not obey the deal with his parents. He was always in his room, playing with his gadget, telling everyone that he studies his lesson and do not
want to be disturbed.
That night, as he woke up, he saw a man near his brothers' crib. It was a big blue man! The man grabbed his brother Sam and was about to eat him and so Yam shouted as loud as he could! His mother went to his room to see what is happening. There, he lay crying in his
sleep! Mother woke him up and told Yam that he had a bad dream, a nightmare! He told his mother about it, he thought his brother Sam was really kidnapped and had been eaten by the
big, blue man.
Thankfully. it was just a bad dream! Since then, he promised to love his baby brother Sam. He will do everything to protect
his brother. From then on, he has begun to love and take care of his brother Sam.

his classmates about the good news. At first, life at home was full of happiness but little by little Yam felt something strange in himself. He was jealous of his baby brother because all their attention was always focused
on Sam. After a month, Mommy went back to work in the office, Baby Sam was left in Grandmother's care, while Yam attended his modular class at home since the pandemic, he spent most of his time playing games with his gadget. His mini /pad was his best friend. He
never bothered to look after his baby brother.
It was always like that when Yam was at home. He always played with his gadget. Mom was busy, Daddy was busy, Lola was busy with Sam. He thinks nobody cares, so he
might as well enjoy his freedom! One day, the teacher talked to his parents during the issuance of the report card. The teacher told them that Yam often submitted his modules without answers on the activities. His tests were also failed. His parents talked to him and was reprimanded about his overuse of
gadgets. His parents threatened him that they will confiscate his pad if he will not study hard.
Yam promised them that he will do better in his studies. Little did his parents know, Yam did not obey the deal with his parents. He was always in his room, playing with his gadget, telling everyone that he studies his lesson and do not
want to be disturbed.
That night, as he woke up, he saw a man near his brothers' crib. It was a big blue man! The man grabbed his brother Sam and was about to eat him and so Yam shouted as loud as he could! His mother went to his room to see what is happening. There, he lay crying in his
sleep! Mother woke him up and told Yam that he had a bad dream, a nightmare! He told his mother about it, he thought his brother Sam was really kidnapped and had been eaten by the
big, blue man.
Thankfully. it was just a bad dream! Since then, he promised to love his baby brother Sam. He will do everything to protect
his brother. From then on, he has begun to love and take care of his brother Sam.
