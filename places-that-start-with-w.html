You can take the challenge of finding the right answers to the problems found below. Be reminded to write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. You can do it! Problem:Originally a rectangle was twice as long as its width. When 5 meters was subtracted from its length and 3 meters was subtracted from its width, the new rectangle had an area of 55 meters. Find the dimensions of the original rectangle. To start, assign a variable for the unknown. Say, Let be the width of the original rectangle be the length of the original rectangle Consider the questions that follow. You are given two choices to each of the question. Place a Check mark (√) on the empty box of your choice. Then, you have to support your answer why you have chosen such. Are you ready? Begin! Questions:1. What will be the mathematical equation that you will obtain based on the information given? (2w - 5)(w - 3) = 55 (2w - 3)(w - 5) = 55 Support your choice: _________________________________________________2. What is the resulting equation when the polynomials are multiplied? 2w² - 11w + 15 = 55 2w² - 11w - 15 = 55 You can show your solution to show your Answer: 3. When the polynomials are placed on one side and the equation is set to zero, what will be the resulting equation?2w² - 11w + 40 = 0 2w² - 11w - 40 = 0 Support your choice: _______________________________________________ 4. What are the factors of the polynomials based on the equation you have in item #3?(2w + 5)(w - 8) = 0 (2w - 5)(w + 8) = 0 Support your choice: _______________________________________________ 5. What are the possible values of the unknown? w = 8 or w = -5/2 w = − 8 or w = 5/2 Support your choice: _______________________________________________ 6. What are the measures of the length and the width of the original rectangle? Width = 8 meters Length = 16 meters Width = 2.5 meters Length = 5 meters Support your choice: _______________________________________________​</a>

Just give quick responses by putting after good interview behavior and x after bad interview behavior. Interview Behavior If you do not like a question at an interview, you should act as if you did not hear the question. b. You should prepare to aggressively defend your thoughts and show some arrogance so that your leadership stands out. If you cannot answer a question, it is better to give a vague answer than admitting that you do not know. d. If you are nervous at an interview, it is helpful to look away from the interviewer as much as you can. e. Keep your mobile phone on vibration mode during the interview. Occasional vibrating sounds show that you are busy and active. If you stop by a possible place of employment to ask if they have job openings, you should behave as you would in an interview. w or X​</a>

                            5. Activity 3: Give it to Me! For sure by now, you are already familiar of how real-life applications on factoring can be solved. You can take the challenge of finding the right answers to the problems found below. Be reminded to write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. You can do it! Problem:Originally a rectangle was twice as long as its width. When 5 meters was subtracted from its length and 3 meters was subtracted from its width, the new rectangle had an area of 55 meters. Find the dimensions of the original rectangle. To start, assign a variable for the unknown. Say, Let be the width of the original rectangle be the length of the original rectangle Consider the questions that follow. You are given two choices to each of the question. Place a Check mark (√) on the empty box of your choice. Then, you have to support your answer why you have chosen such. Are you ready? Begin! Questions:1. What will be the mathematical equation that you will obtain based on the information given? (2w - 5)(w - 3) = 55 (2w - 3)(w - 5) = 55 Support your choice: _________________________________________________2. What is the resulting equation when the polynomials are multiplied? 2w² - 11w + 15 = 55 2w² - 11w - 15 = 55 You can show your solution to show your Answer: 3. When the polynomials are placed on one side and the equation is set to zero, what will be the resulting equation?2w² - 11w + 40 = 0 2w² - 11w - 40 = 0 Support your choice: _______________________________________________ 4. What are the factors of the polynomials based on the equation you have in item #3?(2w + 5)(w - 8) = 0 (2w - 5)(w + 8) = 0 Support your choice: _______________________________________________ 5. What are the possible values of the unknown? w = 8 or w = -5/2 w = − 8 or w = 5/2 Support your choice: _______________________________________________ 6. What are the measures of the length and the width of the original rectangle? Width = 8 meters Length = 16 meters Width = 2.5 meters Length = 5 meters Support your choice: _______________________________________________​</h2><br />
