Her friend, Regina, helps her through advertising her services through Regina’s internet blogsite. Another friend, Vicky, helps her manage her financial records and books.The company’s performance for its first year of operations went beyond the expectation of Charlotte to at least break-even.

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</a>

                                            After earning a graduate degree in Engineering Management, Ashton began working for PDRC International. This is a company based in the U.S. which offers engineering, design, and construction services to countries all over the world.Ashton’s work is focused on international development; her first assignment is to lead a team to develop a bid for a highway construction project in East Africa. After the engineering proposal is submitted, Ashton is proud of the work her team has accomplished and promises her manager she will do everything possible to make sure that PDRC receives the contract.PDRC’s bid is well-received, and Ashton and her team are flown to East Africa to finish negotiations. Ashton is thrilled when her company receives the bid; the only stipulation is that they build their construction headquarters in a specific region in the country. Ashton then begins scouting the region for a location to build their headquarters.In order to obtain building permits in the region, Ashton has to negotiate with the local government. As she begins negotiations, she realizes that bribery is both a common and expected practice. If she does not bribe the local officials, she will not be able to build PDRC’s headquarters in that region and consequently will lose the contract; her first managerial project will be a failure. However, it is illegal for a U.S. citizen to bribe a foreign official in order to obtain business; if she is caught for bribery, she could face jail time and her company could be fined millions of dollars.What should she do?​</a>

                                            Exercise 3: Identifying the Ultimate Theme Directions: Below is another debate speech which talks of a certain topic or theme Identify the ultimate theme and write it on the space provided Mother Theresa once said, and I quote. "I only feel angry when I see waste, when I see people throwing away things we could use," unquote Friends, Ladies and gentlemen, good day Lawmakers are now pushing for the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience and we, in the affirmative side firmiy regret its creation For this constructive speech. I will be discussing two arguments why it is not necessary to create the Department of Disaster Resilience under the provisions of House Bill No. 5989 which has already passed the third and final reading in the House of Representatives For my first argument, the proposed creation of DDR fails to justify how it is different from existing institutions that already deal and are effective with disaster relief and response. Vice President Leni Robredo in fact convincingly stated that the government should look into the gaps in exisung agencies instead of creating new ones that will create unnecessary layer in the bureaucracy when in fact existing state agencies are already performing its mandate Furthermore, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman reiterates that the Omice of the Civil Defense, Social Welfare Developmeni, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Public works and Highways (DPWH) among others are actively performing on disaster prevention, mitigation, management and rehabilitation Meanwhile, RA 10121, also known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 provides that the (NDRRMC) is the working group convened during times of crises to ensure the protection and welfare of all Filipinos during disasters or emergencies. Included in its functions are securing communication lines during calamities, issuing warning signals, providing emergency transportation, and facilitating evacuation and rescue missions. It also leads in the provision of engineering, health and rehabilitation, public education and auxiliary services such as fire-fighung and post-calamily measures. This is yet to take into account the contribution of non-government organizations such as the Red Cross and various charities. And these ladies and gentlemen are mere duplications under the proposed creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. We have to remember that to create a Department of Disaster Resilience, there's an expectation that it will hold all these responsibilities and not cause blatant redundancy in the government's functions. PRACTICE HYGIENE PROTOCOLS AT ALL TIMES 6 For my second argument, most countries have separate departments for disaster resilience and response, yet they are still successful, efficient, and effective. In Japan, Thailand, and Singapore, an ad hoc committee is created headed by the prime minister, as needed, in response to particular calamities. In fact, in a study titled, Institutional Issues on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management conducted by Sonny Domingo, the Interational Best Practices and Institutional Platforms was presented and such mentioned that the Southeast Asian countries present good cases of DRRM institutional setups thar address similar regional disaster hazards. Underscored in this study is that, the Malaysian government's disaster response is one of the most functional and effecuve and such design is modeled from those of the Philippines and Indonesia. Considering such result, I am wondering why there is such move to create a Department of Disaster Resilience when in reality, the status quo, the design we are using in disaster response is laudable and is recognized interationally? It is our contention therefore in the affirmative side that our resiliency initiatives have been gaining support in all levels of poliucal subdivisions of the government, including communities and outside stakeholders. And when such current momentum is sustained, the coming years would be witness to the monumental transformation of the institutional landscape for DRRM in the country. Hence, we regret the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience in the Philippines.​</a>

                            7. Activity 4: Charlotte’s Case - Organizing by functionDirections: Read and analyze the case below and answer the guide questions.Charlotte’s Designer and Tailoring Shop started with Php 300, 000 from her savings and Php 100, 000 through a bank loan. She used the bank loan to purchase sewing machines. She also used some money for the construction of her tailoring shop. She bought sewing materials and supplies, which included: textiles, threads, zippers, buttons, scissors, and tailor chalk. She also hired 2 sewers. Charlotte did the following activities during the first year of operations of her business:- Define the target market.- Set sales targets- Set cost and expense targets- Set profit targets- Hire and train dressmakers.- Set compensation of dressmakers.- Set production quota for dressmakers.- Assign machines and supplies for each of the dressmaker.- Provide a commission scheme to sewers.-Coordinate activities of dressmakers.- Appraise performance of dressmakers to check alignment with organizational goals.For the first year, Charlotte was doing most of these tasks needed to deliver services to her customers, except for sewing. Her friend, Regina, helps her through advertising her services through Regina’s internet blogsite. Another friend, Vicky, helps her manage her financial records and books.The company’s performance for its first year of operations went beyond the expectation of Charlotte to at least break-even. The firm’s strong performance is mainly due to orders coming from Indo, Malay, Thai, and Singaporean mothers requesting for Charlotte to design and sew dresses for their 2 – to – 4 year old daughters.Guide Question:1. Describe Charlotte’s designer and tailoring shop as an organization.2. What are its main activities?3.Will a functional structure work for charlotte’s designer and tailoring shop? Why?4. Prepare an organizational structure suited for Charlotte’s Designer and Tailoring Shop?​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Charlotte's Designer and Tailoring Shop</strong> is a small business that provides tailoring and design services for customers.<strong>The main activities of the company</strong> include defining the target market, setting sales and profit targets, hiring and training dressmakers, setting production quotas, providing a commission scheme to sewers, coordinating the activities of the dressmakers, and appraising the performance of the dressmakers.<strong>A functional structure may work well for Charlotte's Designer and Tailoring Shop</strong> because it is a small business with a clear focus on tailoring and design services.

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</h2><br />

                            12. After earning a graduate degree in Engineering Management, Ashton began working for PDRC International. This is a company based in the U.S. which offers engineering, design, and construction services to countries all over the world.Ashton’s work is focused on international development; her first assignment is to lead a team to develop a bid for a highway construction project in East Africa. After the engineering proposal is submitted, Ashton is proud of the work her team has accomplished and promises her manager she will do everything possible to make sure that PDRC receives the contract.PDRC’s bid is well-received, and Ashton and her team are flown to East Africa to finish negotiations. Ashton is thrilled when her company receives the bid; the only stipulation is that they build their construction headquarters in a specific region in the country. Ashton then begins scouting the region for a location to build their headquarters.In order to obtain building permits in the region, Ashton has to negotiate with the local government. As she begins negotiations, she realizes that bribery is both a common and expected practice. If she does not bribe the local officials, she will not be able to build PDRC’s headquarters in that region and consequently will lose the contract; her first managerial project will be a failure. However, it is illegal for a U.S. citizen to bribe a foreign official in order to obtain business; if she is caught for bribery, she could face jail time and her company could be fined millions of dollars.What should she do?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This poses an ethical situation that must be dealt with, which is bribe the governmental officials, which is common in the part of country. Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.</p><p></p><br />

                            25. Exercise 3: Identifying the Ultimate Theme Directions: Below is another debate speech which talks of a certain topic or theme Identify the ultimate theme and write it on the space provided Mother Theresa once said, and I quote. "I only feel angry when I see waste, when I see people throwing away things we could use," unquote Friends, Ladies and gentlemen, good day Lawmakers are now pushing for the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience and we, in the affirmative side firmiy regret its creation For this constructive speech. I will be discussing two arguments why it is not necessary to create the Department of Disaster Resilience under the provisions of House Bill No. 5989 which has already passed the third and final reading in the House of Representatives For my first argument, the proposed creation of DDR fails to justify how it is different from existing institutions that already deal and are effective with disaster relief and response. Vice President Leni Robredo in fact convincingly stated that the government should look into the gaps in exisung agencies instead of creating new ones that will create unnecessary layer in the bureaucracy when in fact existing state agencies are already performing its mandate Furthermore, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman reiterates that the Omice of the Civil Defense, Social Welfare Developmeni, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Public works and Highways (DPWH) among others are actively performing on disaster prevention, mitigation, management and rehabilitation Meanwhile, RA 10121, also known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 provides that the (NDRRMC) is the working group convened during times of crises to ensure the protection and welfare of all Filipinos during disasters or emergencies. Included in its functions are securing communication lines during calamities, issuing warning signals, providing emergency transportation, and facilitating evacuation and rescue missions. It also leads in the provision of engineering, health and rehabilitation, public education and auxiliary services such as fire-fighung and post-calamily measures. This is yet to take into account the contribution of non-government organizations such as the Red Cross and various charities. And these ladies and gentlemen are mere duplications under the proposed creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. We have to remember that to create a Department of Disaster Resilience, there's an expectation that it will hold all these responsibilities and not cause blatant redundancy in the government's functions. PRACTICE HYGIENE PROTOCOLS AT ALL TIMES 6 For my second argument, most countries have separate departments for disaster resilience and response, yet they are still successful, efficient, and effective. In Japan, Thailand, and Singapore, an ad hoc committee is created headed by the prime minister, as needed, in response to particular calamities. In fact, in a study titled, Institutional Issues on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management conducted by Sonny Domingo, the Interational Best Practices and Institutional Platforms was presented and such mentioned that the Southeast Asian countries present good cases of DRRM institutional setups thar address similar regional disaster hazards. Underscored in this study is that, the Malaysian government's disaster response is one of the most functional and effecuve and such design is modeled from those of the Philippines and Indonesia. Considering such result, I am wondering why there is such move to create a Department of Disaster Resilience when in reality, the status quo, the design we are using in disaster response is laudable and is recognized interationally? It is our contention therefore in the affirmative side that our resiliency initiatives have been gaining support in all levels of poliucal subdivisions of the government, including communities and outside stakeholders. And when such current momentum is sustained, the coming years would be witness to the monumental transformation of the institutional landscape for DRRM in the country. Hence, we regret the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience in the Philippines.​</h2><br />
