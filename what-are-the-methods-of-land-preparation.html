                                            What I KnowPRETESTDirection: Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if it iswrong. Write your answer on your notebook.1. Well-puddled and well-prepared soil for lowland rice varieties ensures a soilsurface that is free from weeds, soft and leveled to make planting easy.2. Uneven growth of plants is caused by poor land preparation.3. Harrowing can be best accomplished by leaving just enough water in the field toexpose the high and low spots.4. Levees should be covered with mud to render them unfavorable for rats andinsect pests.5. The land should be plowed and harrowed 4-5 times alternately.6. Fields used solely for year-round rice production must be allowed to rest orfallow for at least 30 days or more before plowing for the next cropping season.7. Proper soil preparation serves to level the field for uniform distribution ofirrigation water, fertilizers and pesticides.8. In rainfed areas, the field is better plowed while it is dry.9. The first harrowing is done 1-2 days after plowing to break the soil clods andto incorporate the stubbles.10. Harrowing is method of land preparation is employed with the use of a rotarytiller drawn by a tractor11. Decomposition produces too much heat and carbon dioxide (CO2) which maycause the newly transplanted seedlings to exhibit fast growth.12. The best time to fix the levee is after the first plowing because the upturnedsoil near the levees can be used for plastering in the work.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. After the last harvest or during the fallow period, the initial land preparation occurs. This is necessary for good weed control and soil enrichment. Preparing your land for planting takes about 34 weeks on average. It's critical that we don't conflate land clearing with land preparation.</p><p>2.Plowing is used to "till" or dig up, mix, and overturn the soil; harrowing is used to break up the soil clods and incorporate plant debris; and leveling is used to level the field. After your last harvest or throughout the fallow period, commence initial land preparation. This is necessary for good weed control and soil enrichment.</p><p>3.From zero-tillage or minimum tillage, which minimizes soil disturbance, to completely 'puddled' soil, which actually damages soil structure, land preparation encompasses a wide range of methods. Plowing is usually used to "till" or dig up, mix, and overturn the soil.</p><br />

                            4. What I KnowPRETESTDirection: Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if it iswrong. Write your answer on your notebook.1. Well-puddled and well-prepared soil for lowland rice varieties ensures a soilsurface that is free from weeds, soft and leveled to make planting easy.2. Uneven growth of plants is caused by poor land preparation.3. Harrowing can be best accomplished by leaving just enough water in the field toexpose the high and low spots.4. Levees should be covered with mud to render them unfavorable for rats andinsect pests.5. The land should be plowed and harrowed 4-5 times alternately.6. Fields used solely for year-round rice production must be allowed to rest orfallow for at least 30 days or more before plowing for the next cropping season.7. Proper soil preparation serves to level the field for uniform distribution ofirrigation water, fertilizers and pesticides.8. In rainfed areas, the field is better plowed while it is dry.9. The first harrowing is done 1-2 days after plowing to break the soil clods andto incorporate the stubbles.10. Harrowing is method of land preparation is employed with the use of a rotarytiller drawn by a tractor11. Decomposition produces too much heat and carbon dioxide (CO2) which maycause the newly transplanted seedlings to exhibit fast growth.12. The best time to fix the levee is after the first plowing because the upturnedsoil near the levees can be used for plastering in the work.​</h2><br />
