Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don&#039;t think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don&#039;t need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won&#039;t do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It&#039;s great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

                                            SCIENTIFIC
METHOD
Observe and identify the
problem
What is the topic or project that you
want to work on?
Gather data
Use available resources (library and
internet resources, consultation with
experts, interview with key informants) to learn as
much about the problem as possible.
Form a hypothesis
This is a sort of educated guess about what you
expect. It is a statement used to predict the
outcome of an experiment.
-
Test the hypothesis
Design and perform an experiment to test your
hypothesis. An experiment has an independent
and dependent variable.
Analyze data
Record observations and analyze the
meaning of the data. Often, you'll
prepare a table or graph of the data
Draw conclusion
Conclude whether to accept or reject
your hypothesis.</a>

Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It's great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

METHOD
Observe and identify the
problem
What is the topic or project that you
want to work on?
Gather data
Use available resources (library and
internet resources, consultation with
experts, interview with key informants) to learn as
much about the problem as possible.
Form a hypothesis
This is a sort of educated guess about what you
expect. It is a statement used to predict the
outcome of an experiment.
-
Test the hypothesis
Design and perform an experiment to test your
hypothesis. An experiment has an independent
and dependent variable.
Analyze data
Record observations and analyze the
meaning of the data. Often, you'll
prepare a table or graph of the data
Draw conclusion
Conclude whether to accept or reject
your hypothesis.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>You have probably learned that the scientific method is a series of steps that help to investigate. To answer those questions, scientists use data and evidence gathered from observations, experience, or experiments to answer their questions.But scientific inquiry rarely proceeds in the same sequence of steps outlined by the scientific method. For example, the order of the steps might change because more questions arise from the data that is collected. Still, to come to verifiable conclusions, logical, repeatable steps of the scientific method must be followed. This video of The Scientific Method Made Easy explains scientific method succinctly and well.</p><br />
