Write your answers on your paper.1. Earthquake is any sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismicwaves through earth's rocks.2. Earthquakes occur on faults.3. The San Andreas Fault is an example of a right lateral fault.4. Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), a governmentagency under DepEd monitors earth movements and maps fault lines,5. Normal faults are a kind of dip-slip fault.6. Reverse faults are formed when rocks are compressed.7. The strike-slip fault is a fracture in the rocks of the earth's crust in which the rockmasses slip past one another parallel to the strike.8. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismicwaves like ripples on a pond.9. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the wavesreach the earth's surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses10.

You tossed again and still a head turned up Do you think the coin is BIASED? Why? a I think the coin is bissed because it favored the heads b i think the coin is biased because it is expected to turn up tail for the next experimenta 6. I think the coin is not biased because both faces of the coin have equal chances of turning up while that of tails is only) d. I think the coin is not biased because the probability of turning heads up is 32 Mrs Castro asked her students to do an activity Afterwards, her students noticed that the experimental probability of tossing tails is 48%, while the mathematical/theoretical probability is 50%. Being an attentive student, how would you explain this to your classmates? a. The experimental probability is wrong b. We should always rely on mathematical/theoretical probability 6. It is normal for experimental probabilities to vary from the theoretical probabilities but for a large number of trials, the two will be very close d. It is abnormal for the experimental probabilmes to differ from the mathematical/theoretical probabilities because the results must be the same 33 if the owner would like the same height for both houses, which of the following is true?

THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.

                        WEEK #1<p></p>Learning Task #1:
<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Questions:
</strong></p>What is the magnitude of Earthquake took place in Manila?Which among of the following is the safest location during an earthquake?Which agency of the government in the Philippines is monitoring the  movement of the earth crust?
What will be produced if there is a sudden movement of the earth's crust due to the release of stress accumulated along geologic faults or by volcanic activity?
What do you call a fracture or crack between two rocks?
<p></p><p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>B. <strong>5.3</strong>. A magnitude 5.3 earthquake shook Metro Manila and other areas in Luzon in September 9, 2019.C. <strong>in an open area</strong>. If you are outside, get into the open area, stay away from buildings, power lines, and such anything else.
A. <strong>PHIVOLCS</strong>. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) is a service institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) that is mandated to mitigate disasters that may arise from volcanic eruptions, tsunami and other related geotectonic phenomena including earthquake.
D. <strong>earthquake</strong>. An earthquake is a sudden movement of the Earth, caused by the sudden release of a strain accumulated over a long period of time. It may cause many deaths, injuries and may even cause to a damage property.
C. <strong>fault</strong>. A fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock. Faults allow the blocks to move relative to each other.
Learning Task 2:<p></p><p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>Which of the following faults occurs where the “hanging wall” moves up or is thrust over the “footwall”?Which fault is characterized on which the two blocks slide past one another?What type of stress causes the formation of mountains?Pangea break off into seven continents, what could be the probable cause of this event?Friction between the two sides of a fault keeps it from moving until the stress on the fault overcomes the friction, then the fault slips and creates an earthquake.<p></p><p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>B. <strong>Reverse Fault</strong>. This is a fault where the rock above the fault plane has been displaced upwards relative to the rock below the fault plane.C. <strong>Strike-Slip Fault</strong>. This is a fault on which the two blocks slide past one another.D. <strong>Compression Stress</strong>. Mountains are a result of high-impact compression stress caused by the collision of two plates.C. <strong>Tension Stress</strong>. Some scientists think that tension stress caused the Pangaea to break off into the seven continents.A. <strong>True</strong>. It is true that fault slips and creates an earthquake after friction keeps it from moving.

                            29. Guys patulong po kung paano pa gawan ng maikling report about sa topic na to?          HISTORY O. THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.

Expository, persuasive, narrative, and descriptive writing are the four main types of writing. Each of these writing techniques has particular language traits and goals. In many academic texts, you will need to use many types.</p><p></p><p>The most often used citation styles are APA and MLA, but CMS is also used; it's just less common among undergraduates. It is advisable to be aware that CMS is typically used in situations involving academic publishing and traditional book publishing if you are composing a post-graduate thesis. Four things are necessary for writing to be effective: audience recognition, goal clarification, message development, and style and tone choice.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about citation here:</strong> brainly.ph/question/2457726#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
