The Philippine army is to be knowledgeable capable and responsive army that's a source of national pride. to arrange such units as maybe necessary for the effective implementation of national defense plans and programs and soldiers missions To train, organize and equip all Army reserve units for the possible expansion of the peacetime Army component to satisfy any emergency; and To perform such functions because the upper authorities may direct. Considered collectively of the foremost battle-hardened, professional armies within the globe due to their long exposure to left-wing Communist insurgency, various Muslim separatist groups, various extreme right-wing groups and various international campaigns in support of democracy. The AFP also engage in nonmilitary activities, like providing disaster relief, constructing civilian housing, and participating in literacy campaigns. Its foundation day is well-known every December 21st. The National Defense College of the Philippines (NDC) and Philippine academy (PMA) are the principal defense training institutions. A nation enjoying and sustaining its natural resources and a clean and healthy environment. To mobilize our citizenry in protecting, conserving, and managing the environment and natural resources for the present and future generations. government should seriously enhance the AFP is material and technical capabilities. and eventually, the restoration of unit cohesiveness and therefore the culture of excellence within the AFP must be made a priority if the organization is to stay effective.</a>

Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet.

Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. There's so much to give yet so much to lose.​</a>

Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer, and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees, we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. We need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of 8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. So much to give. So much to lose. As the Secretary for the environment, I say we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. We will also plant bamboo - which is superb in carbon sequestration. But this bamboo can also build strong six story buildings, low-cost housing, floor tiles, textiles, clean our polluted waterways. In essence, adaptation, mitigation, inclusive economic growth does not have to be separate activities or choices. These objectives can all be achieved given the right approach. Because the Philippines is in the "firing line" of climate change. I propose that we be one venue for scientists as we explore ways for humanity to move forward. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message - it can be done, and we can do it! There is an integration of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non-negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future.Judging the Author's Reasoning: Answer the following questions.​</a>

In this critical period of our history, we need the heart, the soul and the vigor of the youth of our land to help us build our country on the most enduring basis of brotherhood and solidarity of all Filipinos. I am, therefore, happy to know of the integration of the Filipino youth and that the Filipino youth is now on the march. The question is: Where is it going? Is it marching with irresistible will and determination toward progress and civilization, peace and order, and the prosperity and happiness of the Fatherland? If it is, I, as the chosen head of our nation and our people, heartily welcome it and bid it Godspeed.
It is trite saying that the future belongs to youth, especially to those dynamic, aggressive and self-confident young men and women who have foresight. Thus, they have the bounden duty to ensure it. So much faith the greatest Filipino patriot and hero, Rizal, had in the youth of the land that while he was still in his teens, he dedicated to it his prize winning poem entitled “To the Filipino Youth,” and he called the Filipino youth not without reason and justification “Fair hope of my Fatherland.”
Several years later, when Rizal was in Madrid, he thought again of the Filipino youth. On the occasion of the signal honor and distinction conferred upon the famous Filipino painter Juan Luna when one of his paintings was awarded the highest prize in the artistic world, Rizal offered a touching toast. He expressed the fervent hope that the worthy and commendable examples of Juan Luna, and Resurrection, another famed Filipino painter, will be imitated or emulated by the Filipino youth. In the course of a few years that youth had become to him more than the “fair hope of my fatherland”; it had become the “sacred hope of my Fatherland.”
Rizal’s fair and sacred hope is represented by the young men and women of today, by you, the Filipino youth on the march, you who will be either the leaders and masters of your country and your country’s fate tomorrow or the hewers of wood and drawers of water for other people more ambitious and far-seeing than you, men with vision, with courage, and with an indomitable will to succeed whatever be the obstacles.
Inspired by the same noble sentiment, the late Dr. Rafael Palma, builder of the University of the Philippines, dedicated to the same youth, to the same “fair and sacred hope” of the Fatherland, his last work and masterpiece, his life-size biography of Rizal. In his dedicatory remarks he gave voice to his abiding faith and confidence in the ability of the Filipino young men and women to make good.
Have they made good or are they making good? Were Rizal living today would he be proud of them? Would he say, if he could see them from beyond the tomb, that he did not die in vain, that his country’s sacred and beautiful hope has not disappointed him and those who like him had given their full measure of sacrifice for the glory of their Fatherland?
How fare the youth of the land? Are they planting the seeds that will make their country great? Do they realize the serious problems that now confront the Republic of the Philippines, which is their Republic, and are they contributing to the fullest extent to the solution of such problems? Are they putting their strong and broad shoulders on the wheel of progress and prosperity? Are they helping actively in the complete restoration of peace and order in their country and in the gigantic reconstruction work which both the people and the government must undertake? Are they doing their duty as citizens of the Republic, working for the common happiness and welfare of their respective communities?
As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Are the Filipino young men and women of today sowing the seeds of peace and prosperity so that they will reap the fruits of progress and tranquillity? Man is the archetype of society. Both society and the nation grow as the individuals grow. Unless our youth prepare for the future, there will be no future for them.
“I want to let those who deny us every feeling of patriotism,” wrote Rizal, “that we know how to die for our duty and for our convictions. What matters death if one dies for what one loves, for one’s country, and for those one adores?”
In one of his parting letters he wrote “My future, my life, my joys, all I have sacrificed for my love for her”—referring to the Philippines. “Whatever be my fate, I will die blessing her and wishing her the dawn of her redemption.” That, you will agree, is a wonderful sentiment. Does the Filipino youth of today feel and cherish it?</a>

The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet.

Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic.

                            18. Activity: Judge a Speech: Read the text to answer the given activities. Climate change is a change in climate patterns attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. Read and analyze the speech of former Secretary of Department of Natural Resources (DENR), Gina Lopez, about climate change at a conference in Marrakech, Morocco on November 17, 2016. After reading, answer the questions that follow. Do not forget to place your answers on your answer sheet. "Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life, some of which includes a snail - the venom of which has been found by a Nobel laureate to be better than morphine in addressing pain without the side effects. Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer, and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees, we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. We need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of 8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. So much to give. So much to lose. As the Secretary for the environment, I say we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. We will also plant bamboo - which is superb in carbon sequestration. But this bamboo can also build strong six story buildings, low-cost housing, floor tiles, textiles, clean our polluted waterways. In essence, adaptation, mitigation, inclusive economic growth does not have to be separate activities or choices. These objectives can all be achieved given the right approach. Because the Philippines is in the "firing line" of climate change. I propose that we be one venue for scientists as we explore ways for humanity to move forward. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message - it can be done, and we can do it! There is an integration of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non-negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future.Judging the Author's Reasoning: Answer the following questions.​</h2><br />

Issue: Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno blamed the whopping 6.4% inflation rate on August as the highest in 10 years.• It is sure considered as failure since having inflation and rice deterioration is a burden to Philippine economy. It only conveys that the economy itself is being pulled down by these factors that need to be on top priority. 4. Issue: Changing the last lines of Lupang Hinirang, as proposed by Senate President Vicente Sotto III. • The alteration of the Philippine National Anthem denotes not only disrespect of history but also lack of government's accountability. If one is truly concerned for his country, then he must do his best and do what's right.5. Issue: Viral video of teenagers who had beaten an old man in the jeepney just to steal his purse. •This simple yet devastating crime committed by them is very alarming and the government should lower the criminal liability to 12 years old.(WALA PO ITONG KWENTO)​</h2><br />

The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail. Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic.

                            22. Find 10 Active and Passive sentences in President Laurel's Speech.
In this critical period of our history, we need the heart, the soul and the vigor of the youth of our land to help us build our country on the most enduring basis of brotherhood and solidarity of all Filipinos. I am, therefore, happy to know of the integration of the Filipino youth and that the Filipino youth is now on the march. The question is: Where is it going? Is it marching with irresistible will and determination toward progress and civilization, peace and order, and the prosperity and happiness of the Fatherland? If it is, I, as the chosen head of our nation and our people, heartily welcome it and bid it Godspeed.
It is trite saying that the future belongs to youth, especially to those dynamic, aggressive and self-confident young men and women who have foresight. Thus, they have the bounden duty to ensure it. So much faith the greatest Filipino patriot and hero, Rizal, had in the youth of the land that while he was still in his teens, he dedicated to it his prize winning poem entitled “To the Filipino Youth,” and he called the Filipino youth not without reason and justification “Fair hope of my Fatherland.”
Several years later, when Rizal was in Madrid, he thought again of the Filipino youth. On the occasion of the signal honor and distinction conferred upon the famous Filipino painter Juan Luna when one of his paintings was awarded the highest prize in the artistic world, Rizal offered a touching toast. He expressed the fervent hope that the worthy and commendable examples of Juan Luna, and Resurrection, another famed Filipino painter, will be imitated or emulated by the Filipino youth. In the course of a few years that youth had become to him more than the “fair hope of my fatherland”; it had become the “sacred hope of my Fatherland.”
Rizal’s fair and sacred hope is represented by the young men and women of today, by you, the Filipino youth on the march, you who will be either the leaders and masters of your country and your country’s fate tomorrow or the hewers of wood and drawers of water for other people more ambitious and far-seeing than you, men with vision, with courage, and with an indomitable will to succeed whatever be the obstacles.
Inspired by the same noble sentiment, the late Dr. Rafael Palma, builder of the University of the Philippines, dedicated to the same youth, to the same “fair and sacred hope” of the Fatherland, his last work and masterpiece, his life-size biography of Rizal. In his dedicatory remarks he gave voice to his abiding faith and confidence in the ability of the Filipino young men and women to make good.
Have they made good or are they making good? Were Rizal living today would he be proud of them? Would he say, if he could see them from beyond the tomb, that he did not die in vain, that his country’s sacred and beautiful hope has not disappointed him and those who like him had given their full measure of sacrifice for the glory of their Fatherland?
How fare the youth of the land? Are they planting the seeds that will make their country great? Do they realize the serious problems that now confront the Republic of the Philippines, which is their Republic, and are they contributing to the fullest extent to the solution of such problems? Are they putting their strong and broad shoulders on the wheel of progress and prosperity? Are they helping actively in the complete restoration of peace and order in their country and in the gigantic reconstruction work which both the people and the government must undertake? Are they doing their duty as citizens of the Republic, working for the common happiness and welfare of their respective communities?
As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Are the Filipino young men and women of today sowing the seeds of peace and prosperity so that they will reap the fruits of progress and tranquillity? Man is the archetype of society. Both society and the nation grow as the individuals grow. Unless our youth prepare for the future, there will be no future for them.
“I want to let those who deny us every feeling of patriotism,” wrote Rizal, “that we know how to die for our duty and for our convictions. What matters death if one dies for what one loves, for one’s country, and for those one adores?”
In one of his parting letters he wrote “My future, my life, my joys, all I have sacrificed for my love for her”—referring to the Philippines. “Whatever be my fate, I will die blessing her and wishing her the dawn of her redemption.” That, you will agree, is a wonderful sentiment. Does the Filipino youth of today feel and cherish it?</h2><br />

                            27. PLEASE ANSWER CORRECTLY :(((Read the following speech below. Then pick out the cohesive devices used in the statements.Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail. Our sponges and shells pre effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planet's history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. There's so much to give yet so much to lose. 7 As the Secretary for the environment, we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message it can be done, and we can do it! The rules of the Paris Agreement can state what the performance indicators of these models should be. There is an integratedness of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non- negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future. ​</h2><br />
